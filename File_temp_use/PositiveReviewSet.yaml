    text: Spoilers**Brought prison break intensity back. This episode has everything.
      Best episode so far. From brothers reunion to villain behind all of this. There
      was a clear and believable explanation for Michael fake death. There were many
      scenes where you will experience adrenaline rush. SO SO WAITING FOR THE NEXT

    text: Most Prison Break Episodes are gripping and have clever decisions involved.
      This one is perhaps one of the best episodes in terms of anticipation and the
      kind of masterminding Michael does.The subtle underplay of dialogs where the
      General says, "Frustration must be killing you" and then Michael also returns
      the "Frustration must be killing you" ! "Leverage" on the phone call... and
      "they'll all see you coming." and then the "See you at the Rendezvous" comes
      in even in this season.An amazing amazing episode! Totally blown by the execution.Of
      course every episode of Prison Break tells you that the boys had one victory
      but are going to face another challenge and that is what happens towards the
      end of this episode as well, and you get the drift when you actually see that
      everything seems to easy, and you know something is going to give.Also, Self
      had started to act a lil shaken, and if you consider that he was going to drive
      around the city so carelessly, you get the hint something is cooking.

    text: hi I'm still quite young a teenager actually. i've been glued to the chair
      every Tuseday night. and i give out if someone even whispers a word to me. while
      i'm watching it. it is one of the best TV shows i have ever seen. i used to
      think lost was good but prison break is much better. lost just drags on and
      on and never seems to end. prison break at the moment is very good and i can't
      wait to watch it next week. i never imagined that Micheal(Wenthworth Miller)
      would burn himself. and that the tattoo would burn just were the needed to use
      it.they should make more TV shows like this one this is the best one and i son't
      ever want it to end i nearly cry when it ends every Tuseday only joking but
      i don't want it 2 end i can't wait till the first season is over cause i'm going
      to buy it but i don't want it to b over for a while cause then i'd have nothing
      to watch at all and that would be terrible

    text: Eight hours after the escape, Michael, Lincoln, Sucre, C-Note and Abruzzi
      continue to run for their lives as Special Agent Alexander Mahone is brought
      in from the FBI to lead the search for the fugitives.Hours earlier they pulled
      off the greatest break in US history, but as many people know the greatest laid
      plans of mice and men don't always go the way they are planed. When Abruzzi's
      plane took off, they have to go with plan "B". This involves a place called
      Oswego more specifically "Ripe Chance Woods". But for all the planing Michael
      did, he did not count on Special Agent Alexander Mahone, a man who like Michael
      sees patterns where everybody else sees chaos. Meanwhile Veronica, has confronted
      Terrence Steadman(played now by Jeff Perry because John Billingsley left to
      join the cast of the series "The Nine")and discovers that he is not hiding,
      but rather a prisoner of the Blackfoot Mansion, and calls the police to report
      the president of a crime. Back in Oswego, the other fugitives mainly T-Bag,
      stole a cooler full of ice and placing his severed hand inside goes to a clinic
      to have it reattached, but unfortunately for him it's an animal hospital. Mahone
      along with Bellick and other law enforcement track them to a storage facility
      in Oswego, and while Michael and the others are inside they surround the place
      and prepare for a breach just as Lincoln opens the grate entrance. inside the
      storage locker, nothing. A dead end... and where are the fugitives, at Oswego
      cemetery, preparing to dig in the grave of E. Chance Woods, the grave marker
      reading "R.I.P, E. Chance Woods".Down in the grave, they find what was supposed
      to be a weeks worth of clothes for Michael and Lincoln, but since they are five
      of them, the clothes must be dived up. But all is not, well for genius Agent
      Mahone figured out what "Ripe Chance woods" meant. And tracked them to the cemetery.
      But they escape by infiltrating the populace of Oswego. They reach a Garage
      where Michael stashed a car, giving Lincoln a chance to call Veronica. Talking
      to him she tells Lincoln that Terrence is still alive and the police are their,
      the officer tells her to hang up the phone turning to ask him why she stares
      down the barrel of his gun BLAM BLAM BLAM!!!! on the other end of the phone,
      Lincoln collapses in tears. as the episode comes to a close the camera closes
      in on Veronica's dead body, twice in the chest once in the head, by the book
      execution.

      return to the storage room. Michael begs Sara to talk with Veronica and Nick
      first to see the evidences and to ask for clemency to her father. Meanwhile
      Nick and Veronica appeal in court of Judge Kessler and request an exhumation
      of Steadman remains. Michael learns that if something goes wrong with the electric
      chair, the execution is delayed. He uses a rat to short-circuit the electric
      installation, but David overhears the conversation and rats Michael''s talk
      to Captain Bellick. Sara stays with Lincoln in his cell; later Michael and Veronica
      have a last meeting with him and he talks with his son LJ by phone. When Lincoln
      is walking to the electric chair, the governor calls to say that he had reviewed

      dramatic episode of "Prison Break" up to this moment. Dr. Tancredi is really
      involved with Michael and Lincoln and the claws of the Vice-President Caroline
      Reynolds are extending, using her power and influence to execute Lincoln. Fox

    text: My honest opinion is that they should've made this season a bit longer so
      it would be more enjoyable, it just feels so rushed at times,I don't mean 20+
      episodes, that would have been way too stretched. I think 13 to 15 episodes
      is enough.The writing in season 5 is still good(with a bit of flaws but every
      show has it so its alright), directing and acting is also good as usual.but
      after nearly a decade of the show being "over" you would expect those 9 episodes
      to be perfected to the last second. I'm gonna binge watch it soon to see if
      I missed somethingI would love to see more of their back stories, from each
      character, more scenes about prison tension, getting to know the characters,
      more talking about their past, more mysteries and stuff like that. when Whip
      got shot I mean it wasn't believable or anything, it was weird and silly, I
      was like .. ...what the hell ... .. .. [20 seconds later] should I feel sorry
      for him?? or T-Bag for losing his son after only knowing him for 2 days, or
      what??? should I be "oh man why he died... such a shame..." I gotta admit it
      was kinda laughable, that whole situation..., T-bag coming out unarmed like
      "oh no, stop, don't shoot", .he was a decent guy but had no time to get interested
      in him. although Sid's death was tragic, he was a young dude on the run, about
      to flee the country, live free and then he got killedthat is I guess the only
      main issue I have with this final season, it feels so rushed but we still have
      like one or two filler episodes when they were on the run from prison, episode
      5 had nice ending, the prison break style i loved it but that entire episode
      could've been put into 10 minutes or less loll(if you re-watch it you will see)if
      this season were 15 episodes long it would'be been more than great, I love that
      most of the cast got back together to shoot this final season and I appreciate
      them giving us more Prison Break material.

    text: This was one of the best Prison Break episodes for a while, probably the
      best so far in Season 3. It was fast moving, exciting, and ended with a classic
      Prison Break cliff-hanger at the end. With lots of action and events all packed
      into one episode, it did not disappoint. From a critical perspective, there
      were some slightly strange, rather intangible moments, but it does remain to
      be a show which appeals to its viewers by being believable, unlike shows like
      Lost and Heroes.This season has finally kicked into action and everyone will
      be disappointed after the next episode when there will be another long period
      of time before the next offering of the great TV series!

      would finally tie up all the important loose ends and that is what I got.Honestly,
      I would say this episode is not as good as the previous and definitely is not
      one of the best episodes of Prison Break, but what it is... is the finale that
      Prison Break should have had a long time ago. Take for example Breaking Bad
      a series in which the character that turns evil dies at the end. Fitting right?
      For a guy who committed so many crimes to finally pay after getting a somewhat
      redemption. Well as fitting as it is for that show, that''s how much unfitting(couldn''t
      find any other word) was for this show to kill the character at the end. Many
      questions were raised like: How Michael''s tumor came back? Why he would willingly
      kill himself because his tumor came back?(I mean he could have lived for years)
      yet his mum who had a similar condition lived after surgery... well this episode
      is what that ending should have been. I''m not saying it''s the perfect finale
      but it does have some awesome Prison Break moments like: "Truth is whatever
      you tell people it is" or a moment at a warehouse in which I for one couldn''t
      keep up with the mind games and who was doing what was supposed to anymore.
      And above all we have some of the best Michael moments put in Prison Break that
      reminded me of why I liked this show so much. There are twists and revelations
      and moments that will surprise you just as long as you don''t expect this to
      be the "Greatest Finale Ever" but just the finale that we deserved 7 years ago.In
      conclusion I''ll say this once more: This episode is a fitting end to this show
      and one that tied up very nicely all the loose ends that were raised during
      this season and during the final episode of season 4. Seeing this rated with
      8,7(at this moment) on IMDb is a little disrespectful and I guess it''s only
      because we were expecting some of it and the episode wasn''t as artistic as
      the previous one. But in the end all good things and bad things must come to
      the end!'

      there are some elements that indicate that this season is going to be far away
      from the quality of season 1... let's see!The action during the episode is nevertheless
      intensive. But, opposite to other seasons, it seems that the script is not fully
      thought throughout beforehand. Watching season 1 and 2 one had the feeling that
      everything is leading to a big point, however season 4 begins with much less
      sense of inner logic.A good side is that most of the main characters (Linc,
      Mikel, etc) are again in the move, so one can expect a lot of good moments coming.

      for General Krantz to convince him that Sara could kill his daughter. Trishanne
      releases the employees but the coward Mr. White runs and Gretchen shoots and
      kills him. There is a shootout in the office, but Gretchen and T-Bag escape.
      She asks him to dump the MP-5s in the garbage container and then she draws a
      pistol to kill T-Bag; however Trishanne arrives and saves T-Bag. When she arrests
      T-Bag, she identifies herself as FBI Agent Miriam Holtz. General Krantz threatens
      Michael and the group and he tells that the Michael and Lincoln''s father was
      not a data analyst but an executioner of The Company. They leave The Company
      in an armored truck, Michael calls Self and they head to the meeting point,
      chased by many cars. When they arrive in the airport, they are followed by The
      Company''s agents but Michael lures the agents that are arrested by the security
      of the airport. Meanwhile the bodyguards break in the toilet and find Liza tied
      on a flush toilet; she is released and calls Krantz. Sucre and Mahone keep the
      Scylla and they deliver the aimed object to Self. The agent gives an envelope
      to Michael with the documents necessary to clear their records and he asks the
      group to wait for Agent Schmidt that would be coming with vans and an ambulance.
      After one hour, Michael calls Self and get no answer. When Michael opens the
      envelope, there are only blank sheets. Meanwhile Self shoots Miriam on the chest
      and T-Bag witnesses the crime."Selfless" is the best episode of the Fourth Season
      of "Prison Break" so far. The engaging story has many twists and revelations
      and a surprising betrayal. My guess in the last episode was right, with Michael
      bringing General Krantz to the Scylla room to get the sixth card. The relationship
      between Krantz and Liza was a great surprise for me. But the betrayal of Self
      was totally unexpected for me. I regret the fate of Trishanne, a.k.a. Miriam
      Holtz, since I liked her character. General Krantz losing his arrogance and
      self-confidence is another great moment of this show. The book Michael left
      in his backpack ("All''s Well That Ends Well") is a play by William Shakespeare
      that comes from the proverb "All''s well that ends well", which means that problems
      do not matter so long as the outcome is good. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil):

      \ final and most gripping story-line centres on John Abruzzi's struggle to find\
      \ the means whereby he can extract the information he so desires from Scofield.\
      \ Having used brutal torture and failed to get Scofield to talk, the pressure\
      \ from his concerned mafia associates intensifies. None more so than from Philly\
      \ Falzone, played with a masterful sense of control by Al Sapienza, already\
      \ familiar to us in a similar guise as the main rival capo faced by Tony Soprano\
      \ in the first season of that landmark series. The audience is left in no doubt\
      \ of the seriousness of the threat posed to Abruzzi, his wife and children by\
      \ Falzone, who will also pay a high price should Fibonacci survive to testify.\
      \ With Lincoln threatening to exact revenge for his brother's mutilation, Scofield\
      \ has to reveal how central Abruzzi is to the escape plans in being able to\
      \ secure a midnight getaway flight when the time comes.In recognition of the\
      \ failure of the use of torture to make Scofield sing, and at the behest of\
      \ Falzone, Abruzzi tries a new tack. As such, he decides to co-operate with\
      \ Scofield in his plans to break out of Fox River, and as a goodwill gesture\
      \ has 'T-Bag' severely beaten. This is more than timely, with the latter having\
      \ been 'tooled up' with a 'gutter'. In both the attack on Scofield and that\
      \ on 'T-Bag', Abruzzi acts with impunity, safe in the knowledge that he can\
      \ do so without fear of any reprisal from Brad Bellick, the senior correctional\
      \ officer at Fox River State Penitentiary.In interview Stormare has revealed\
      \ that the main attraction to the role of Abruzzi was in the changing relationship\
      \ the character develops with the main protagonist, Scofield. As the most internationally\
      \ recognisable member of the cast, Stormare adds real star quality to the acting\

      \ whose unhinged exterior appears to make more evident the array of monsters,\
      \ aside from Abruzzi, who Scofield had spoken of to Dr Tancredi at the episode's\
      \ opening.\nJust as ominous, as Scofield begins his secretive late-night digging\
      \ in the cell, he learns that 'Haywire' suffers from a medical condition which\

      Prison break then goes to a interval with the audience thinking if he is trustable.
      This episode gets more and more closer, but then gives the viewers more entertainment
      and adventure to look forward to. If you are a prison break fan like me, honestly
      you don't want it to end so soon, a few more episodes. This episode focuses
      on 4 main stories, The first is the actual Micheal, Kellerman and Lincoln. This
      keeps you hooked on with some great action and adventure. The Second is the
      Jailer and his day in prison, being forced to be a b i t c h, which is so entertaining
      to watch. The third is T Bag and the family, makes you wonder if he will do
      something nasty, hope not. The fourth is C Note and his dilemma. Anyway this
      episode was enjoyable. As usual another great episode.

    text: Surprised by the low rating this movie got, but in my opinion it was the
      most satisfying episode to date and one of the best of this resurrection series.
      Here's my report:This episode was the one with the most revelations up until
      now. The story that Michael tells Linc is one I'd expect since Sara was not
      legally free at the end of season 4. But what I didn't like was that this episode
      made Kellerman useless in the season 4 end. Michael says Poseidon told him that
      Kellerman didn't have the "authority" to exonerate their crimes, but this might
      be just a lie told by Poseidon... we can all interpret as we each want. What
      I did like was the fact that among his story he finally said that all this was
      in order to make Sarah and Linc free, which makes a lot of sense and fill in
      a lot of the holes the season 4 finale had. The rest of the episode is basic
      Prison Break manhunt with the group trying to get away from ISIL after killing
      their leader. Jacob does something that surprised and intrigued me for the rest
      of this season with him catching those two henchmen. Overall this is a very
      satisfying episode and as a fan I'm sure that anyone could enjoy because this
      is what the fans wanted for so long. The only thing that I didn't like was that
      part of the revelation of Michael. In the end I'd say this is one of the best
      episodes of this resurrection series and makes up for the series 4 dreadful
      finale.

      Sucre. Bellick and T-Bag are out of jail. But the impossible happens: Sara is
      alive, and Michael now is teaming-up with Bellick and Mahone in the same side.
      I hope they are not double-crossed by Agent Don Self. Now there is another killer
      (Wyatt) chasing them. Let''s see whether the number of new situations this Season
      works like the others did. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available'

    text: 'Directed by two-time Emmy director and cinematographer, Michael Watkins,
      of ''Quantum Leap'' and ''X-files'' fame, this episode maintained the pace and
      quality of its earlier pilot, while building to a series of finales, all of
      which would more than suffice alone to make this a far above average TV serial.
      One strand of the story- line concerns the ongoing re-investigation of Lincoln''s
      case by Michael''s attorney, and Lincoln''s former girlfriend, Veronica Donovan.
      A recognisable face from her roles in ''The Craft'' and ''Vertical Limit'',
      Robin Tunney struggles to bring a level of credibility to her character, given
      the latter''s propensity to oscillate radically in her interpretation of Burrow''s
      guilt or innocence in line with the latest shred of evidence. Accessing video
      evidence from Lincoln''s trial lawyer, comprising security camera footage from
      the scene of the crime, Veronica is dismayed to clearly witness her ex approach
      the deceased vice-president''s brother''s car and open fire. Yet, when she challenges
      him, he is adamant that he was framed, shocked to discover both the victim there,
      and that the man was already dead. Given that Lincoln remains the only one with
      motive enough, having been sacked by, and having had a public fracas with the
      victim, it becomes imperative that Veronica track down the only individual who
      could corroborate the reason why he was present and armed at the scene. Back
      at Fox River, at the commencement of this second episode, a race riot appears
      imminent, and despite Scofield''s assurances that all details of the escape
      plan have been thoroughly worked out to account for all eventualities, Lincoln
      counters his brother''s self-confidence by warning that the one factor which
      cannot be so controlled concerns the unpredictability of people, especially
      in such a volatile environment. Once again written by the show''s creator, this
      episode makes evident Burrow''s words of caution, with individuals aplenty who
      pose both a physical threat, and a risk to the success of Scofield''s schemes.
      The first of these is kidnapper, rapist, murderer, and white supremacist, Theodore
      ''T-Bag'' Bagwell. With a penchant for young handsome inmates, Scofield attracts
      his unwanted attention while attempting to extract a bolt from one of the bleachers
      under this ruthless sexual predator''s control: ''All you gotta a do is take
      this pocket right here, and ya life''ll be all peaches and cream''. In attempting
      to retrieve this vital component in his escape plan, he has it confiscated by
      ''T-Bag'' for refusing the latter''s advances, and in being caught trying to
      recover said item from T-Bag''s cell Scofield feigns interest in participating
      in the forthcoming conflict with the African American prison populace. Witnessed
      seemingly choosing the supremacists'' side, Scofield draws the animosity and
      distrust of his fixer ''C-Note'', thereby, placing at risk the supply of the
      drug Pugnac, necessary to suppress his insulin levels to get access to the infirmary.
      As if the menace posed by fellow prisoners at Fox River is not sufficient, Scofield
      also invites the wrath of the commanding officer of the prison guards, Brad
      Bellick, for enjoying the protection of Keach''s prison warden: ''He may run
      this place during the day, but I run it during the night.'' Veronica''s continued
      delving into the case leads to the coming forward of the crucial witness'' terrified
      girlfriend, who reveals that Lincoln''s witness died not long after his conviction,
      victim of an overdose, an impossibility given the fact his heart condition precluded
      him from being a drug user. It also draws the unwelcome attention of the sinister
      Secret Service team, and their as-yet unidentified female boss who gives them
      sanction to remove all encumbrances to Burrows'' execution. Secondly, the tinderbox
      at Fox River is lit and in the ensuing melee scores are settled and as the guards
      begin to reassert their control, ''T-Bag'' is horrified to see his lifeless
      and bloodied ''girlfriend'' draped over Scofield. The audience are witness to
      ''T- Bag''s'' unnerving howls swearing vengeance after lockdown, while Scofield
      starts working in his cell on the bolt he stripped from the ''girlfriend''s''
      grasp. Finally, the significance of the episode''s title is revealed as Scofield
      fashions the bolt into an allen key to start dismantling the toilet unit at
      the rear of his cell. As if all these plot developments are not enough, Abruzzi,
      under pressure himself from his mob bosses to discover Fibronacci''s whereabouts,
      loses patience, and in his desperation has his ''heavies'' inflict an injury
      on Scofield which almost rivals the shock value of Peter Stormare''s ''wood
      chipper'' moment in ''Fargo''. Still, this is indubitably Robert Knepper''s
      episode in which he amply demonstrates his acting talent and takes hold with
      both hands this opportunity to shine in the memorable role of ''T-Bag'', so
      disturbingly capturing the menace of one of the most monstruous villains ever
      portrayed on the small screen. As Knepper later recounted, he was intending
      to quit acting as the industry was so hard to break into, but upon declaring
      this intention to fellow gym client, Kiefer Sutherland, the latter punched him
      and told him never to give up. Our gain.'

    text: This episode reminded me how much i liked the old seasons of prison break.
      It's a classic example of the fact that nothing is what it seems to be. I'll
      try not to reveal any spoilers.After some episodes that just dragged the action
      of this season, I was beginning to lose interest in the show. And even though
      not everything ties perfectly with the end of season 4, this episode did a fantastic
      job at revealing things and setting up other things for the final episode. There
      are a few moments of Scofield classic in this episode and some revelations that
      will surprise you and in fact will make sense. But the end of the episode is
      what made it great and left me wanting so bad to see the finale. There are a
      lot of surprises in this episode and cliffhangers that just reminded me of how
      good the beginning of the series was. In conclusion I'll say this was at first
      sight the best episode of prison break ever, up there with "Go" and "Selfless"
      which in my opinion were the best ever. Although a lot of people trashed this
      series for being dragged and being empty with nothing happening, I'm glad I
      had the patience to wait and see probably the best episode of prison break ever
      in my opinion!

      When Lincoln decides to meet Christina again, his life is in serious jeopardy.After

      again, and I recapped watching the last episode again to remember how this series
      abruptly ended a couple of days before Christmas. The plot now is too complicated
      and I do not know how the author will resolve the story with a decent conclusion
      since neither General Krantz nor Christina are the "good guys" and it seems
      that it will be very difficult for Michael and Lincoln to get free in the end.
      The end of this show gives a glimpse of how much Christina cares for Lincoln.
      The last chance for a good resolution of "Prison Break" was when Self appeared
      like a representative of the government promising amnesty for the group. Now
      it seems to be very difficult to have a good solution due to the huge power
      of the Company, where everybody seems to be involved. The romance between the
      selfish and egocentric Michael and the sweet Sara has a total lack of chemistry

      a little worry for the brothers. Then he told him Kellerman was the man pulling
      strings and it didn't reassure me at all. All along it was really hard to anticipate
      things and as usual the writers played with our mind. Moreover T-Bag was in
      big trouble considering he failed to prevent the knight from saving the damsel
      in distress. So he tried his best not to be killed and convince the General
      that he was still a useful asset. One of his scene with other characters should
      even make laugh out loud. In fact I think our feelings are mesmerized because
      we know it's the last episode ever.But this episode was also about rescuing
      Lincoln. Mahone continued as planned but as expected dealing with the mother
      wasn't easy. So Scylla continued its puzzling dance like a ship caught in a
      storm. Waves after waves the characters struggled to get their hands on it but
      finally the story ended. The fight was finally over and the decisions that had
      to be made weren't easy to take. But of course the most interesting thing wasn't
      actually the Scylla arc but what happened to the people revolving around it,
      like planets around a sun. Again the direction and editing were flawless and
      each character had a scene dedicated to covering its "after Scylla life". Watching
      these scenes you should have conflicted feelings because it's not all black
      and white, like in wars there have been many casualties during these four seasons.
      The important thing is that the end is smart and done the right way. I even
      see it as a TV show model for future productions. The very last scene also managed
      to bring back so many memories that it's nearly impossible to put in words how
      great it is. I can only compare it to the end of Forrest Gump, when the feather
      begins to fly in the wind. It was just magical and fans will never forget it.

      will not be disappointed.Michael Schofield is a successful, wealthy, very intellectual
      man with a good honest life and everything going right for him. Except for one
      thing... his brother Lincoln is imprisoned and set to be executed for the crime
      of murdering the Vice President's brother and Michael is convinced he is innocent.After
      all appeals have been exhausted, Michael knows the only way to save his brother's
      life is to break into Fox River and then break out... The episode begins showing
      only briefly what he has been planning and the extent to which he has researched
      everything about the prison, some of the inmates, and his plan. It seems to
      me like this works exceptionally well because we can see how he has the plan
      mapped out to every detail for the escape, and how to stay on the outside after
      breaking out, even before we ever see him. But as he beings implementing it
      throughout the season - each stage of it is new, engages the audience and you
      appreciate the brilliance of this man Michael Scofield. I don't want to rate
      the Pilot higher than 8 because I feel it goes into the plot too quickly, and
      Michael's incarceration feels rushed when it should have really being drawn
      out longer in the first episode. Nevertheless, it's still a very strong start
      for a very strong series.

      relationship was further developed. The story focused more on the mother and
      her complex personality. In fact I specially enjoyed the scene between her and
      Sara. As expected the General landed in Miami and clashed with Lincoln's team.
      The whole Scylla arc was also very interesting and the writing nearly fascinating.
      Even after everything that happened to them I wasn't expecting that. It's a
      twist ! A cliffhanger ? No it's a real break through !The dream ending the show
      deserves is happening right now. Viewers, you better stay tuned !

    text: '''It''s a pattern...The tattoos. There''s a maze...It''s a pathway.''The
      fourth episode, and the first of fifteen to be written by co- executive producer,
      and former writer and producer of ''NYPD Blue'', Matt Olmstead, opens with a
      wonderful tension-filled sequence as the audience share Lincoln''s nightmare
      of being woken unexpectedly and taken to execution without having had time to
      prepare. Though originally considered too handsome by the show''s creator to
      portray this rugged individual, the Australian actor, Dominic Purcell, in this
      scene illustrates perfectly his suitability for the role. A former classmate
      at drama college with Hugh Jackman, Purcell was previously known in the States
      for his role as the savant with no past in the Fox series ''John Doe'', before
      landing this plum role as Death Row inmate, Lincoln Burrows. It is at Lincoln''s
      suggestion that his former girlfriend, and now attorney, consult ''Project Justice'',
      an organisation established to aid those wrongly convicted, about his case.
      Given the lack of evidence to support his plea, the organisation decides it
      must devote its meagre resources to more deserving cases. Step forward, too-good-to-be-true,
      Nick Savarin, one of the lawyers employed by ''Project Justice'', played by
      Frank Grillo. He is drawn to Veronica''s crusade by the uncommonly precipitate
      nature with which Lincoln''s appeals have been rejected, and by Savarin''s experience
      of his own father''s having served a long sentence for a crime he didn''t commit.
      The main thrust of this episode, however, concerns the threat to Scofield''s
      plans posed by his new cell-mate, ''Haywire'', recently released from psych-ward.
      Imprisoned for killing his own parents, he suffers from a schizoaffective disorder,
      together with an inability to sleep. Not only does his presence prevent Scofield
      from tunneling out of his cell, but ''Haywire''s fascination with his tattoos
      could compromise the whole escape plan. For this and other episodes where we
      witness Scofield''s full-body markings, Miller had to spend four and a half
      hours in make-up, while their design was the work of tattoo artist, Tom Berg,
      who Brett Ratner brought to the project after his work for him on 2002''s ''Red
      Dragon''. The future star of ''Grimm'', Silas Weir Mitchell, who had originally
      auditioned for the role of ''T-Bag'', brings a real sense of menace to his performance.
      As Scofield is increasingly compelled to act to meet his deadline and avoid
      retribution from Abruzzi, the writer cleverly weaves into the narrative several
      indicators that the eponymous poison will be employed in a desperate ploy to
      rid himself of ''Haywire''s'' unwanted attentions. Yet, once he has self- inflicted
      an injury to achieve this aim, the true practical use of the chemical composition
      hidden within the markings of his tattoo is revealed. With Sucre''s return,
      now committed to the intended escape as a consequence of his rival''s moves
      on his girlfriend, and progress finally made in breaking through the back of
      their cell, the audience are made aware of a far more serious, impending threat
      to the plan''s success. In their ongoing attempts to derail Vernica''s investigations
      into Lincoln''s case, the sinister secret service team unveil Scofield''s true
      identity as Burrow''s brother. Consequently plans are afoot for his immediate
      transfer out of Fox River.'

      to find the representative of the owner of Scylla. Meanwhile Michael awakes
      locked in a house in the woods under the surveillance of bodyguards of The Company.
      The psychiatrist Dr. Roger Knowlton tells him that his mother is alive, working
      for The Company in the Madagascar Rainforest and he wants to prepare Michael
      to join The Company and use his skills in global scale working with his mother.
      Tia lures Lincoln and escapes from him, but he keeps her wallet and finds her
      address. General Krantz receives Sara that tells that she wants to stay with
      Michael, but he says no to her. T-Bag and Self go to Tia''s house and Self plots
      against the leadership of Lincoln. They bring pictures and a HDthey found in
      the house, and when Self argues with Lincoln, Mahone arrives and balances the
      situation. Gretchen believes that it is an inside job in The Company. Michael
      sees pictures of his childhood and recalls his family reunion while Dr. Knowlton

      and calls General Krantz that orders Dr. Knowlton to drug Michael for transportation.
      However Michael reverts the situation and escapes running through the woods.
      Sara runs over the car of The Company''s men and rescues Michael. When the group
      meets Scott, there is a shootout and Gretchen is hit and left behind. In the
      end, the surprising owner of Scylla finally appears.In "The Sunshine State"
      we see four enemies working together and the childhood recollections of Michael.
      Lincoln accepts to work with Gretchen, T-Bag and Self and fortunately for him
      Mahone joins the team. Michael feels depressed with the information that his
      mother is alive and Sara saves him. The discovery that his mother is alive is
      quite inconsistent since why should The Company frame the son of one of the
      most important employees? But the greatest surprise is the identity of the owner
      of Scylla in the end of the episode. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available.Note:

      naive Apolskis enters Fox River putting on his ''prison face''. Oblivious to
      the racial tensions within Fox River and clearly having little knowledge about
      how he should behave in a prison. Apolskis'' sharp attitude, and desire to integrate
      with the black inmates quickly fuel resentment towards him from both the black
      and white inmates.Looking for fresh meat and a new boy to hold his pocket, T-Bag
      soon targets the confused and quickly isolated youngster giving him the nickname
      ''Tweener'' and continues to pursue him with relentless sexual harassment. As
      Michael begins to feel a sense of responsibility to protect the boy from the

      start by seeing a exploded car on a ditch and agent Mahone is looking at it.
      But then, fade out and a title appears saying "12 hours earlier". During those
      12 hours earlier, Michael and Lincoln show up at Nika's house to heal Lincoln's
      leg. Michael sets out to get his car back only to fine that it has been taken
      to a car deposit. By the pieces of glass on the street, Michael realizes that
      a window of the car was broken. In the car there was everything they needed
      to disappear, but now a bag that was on the back seat has fallen into the hands
      of Mahone, who finds a passport with Michael's face on it but only with some
      other name. Bellick goes to a store where he runs into Geary, who was working
      there after being fired. They start fighting but they ended up having a drink
      together. Bellick says he wants to get the reward they are offering for the
      FOX RIVER EIGHT. They agreed to work together in order to find them. For that,
      Bellick uses Manche who, quoting T-Bag, "sang like Johnny Cash". Meanwhile,
      C-Note makes a phone call to his wife from a payed phone. The FBI hears the
      conversation and learn that C-Note is asking his wife to meet him within a week.
      Also, Sucre steals a car after he found out that Maricruz is getting married
      with Hector. The police is on him, but he manages to escape by jumping on a
      train heading to New York. When he got there, a friend of him tells that Maricruz's
      wedding is taking place in Vegas, so Sucre takes his friend's motorcycle and
      goes to Vegas. Getting near to the end of this episode, Michael comes up with
      a plan to get Mahone off their back, so he makes a phone call on purpose so
      that Mahone will track it. Once they tracked the call, they tracked where they
      are and where they're going. They start persecuting them, but Michael and Liconln
      stop at the middle of a bridge, take some bagged flesh and put it on the car
      and push it over the bridge. The car explodes and they run uphill. They meet
      with Nika again, who offers her car to them so that they can go to Mexice. Blindly,
      they start their journey thinking that the Feds will pay attention on the other
      guys, but they had absolutely no idea that Bellick and Geary are right behind
      them, which becomes the start of a new persecution. So, maybe in the next to
      episode, someone's is gonna go down and who that might be, we don't know. It
      could be C-Note or Sucre. But wait, we still got T-Bag, Tweener and Abruzzi.
      The most likely to go down is C-Note, because by the end of the episode, his
      wife helps the feds to haunt him.

    text: After the great pilot episode last week, this episode begins to reveal a
      lot more of the mysteries set in the first episode. For example we learn what
      Michael did and we get a glance on the history of Kaniel in the prison of Ogygia.This
      episode isn't as good as the first but still good in the overall picture of
      the season. This revival seems to feel more like the original seasons, more
      like a combination between the first and third season. The story is good and
      well thought linking parts from all over the places into one big scheme, which
      leaves the audiences wanting to know more about who is behind all in this revival
      series. Above everything else we see the old school Michael and his genius at
      planning his escape and planning everything that happens to everyone around
      or close to him.If there was any doubt for me in the first episode, then this
      got me hooked for rest of the season and hopefully for another one beside this
      one, because honestly I can't see the whole story and mysteries being resolved
      in only one season with 9 episodes.

      in all honesty was a little bit of a let down but season 4 has picked up and

    text: This episode was undeniably awesome, just like all the Prison Break episodes,
      some on different scales than others, of course. The only thing I didn't like,
      and that didn't make much sense, was how General Zavala, Panama's most recognized
      military figure--who managed to bring down the criminal empire of someone like
      Lechero and put him away for life--would be so careless as to not take the proper
      security measures when attempting to rescue LJ. I really liked the General as
      a character--even though is depicted as ruthless and hard, he clearly has a
      softer side and has his intentions on the right track. He and his men apprehend
      Susan B. Anthony/Gretchen Morgan, and bring her in for questioning. Though she
      initially denies any involvement in the escape, General Zavala and his men torture
      her via waterboarding and, even though she's still in denial, ironically they
      can easily surmise her guilt by the fact that she was able to withstand the
      torture--a clear sign that she had been through it before. Afterwards, when
      Whistler identifies her as the woman pulling the strings, she admits that she
      has LJ and tells the General "where", though she denies involvement in the escape.
      What did not make much sense was that the General didn't take the necessary
      precautions, especially someone as experienced as he was. He goes to the site
      with only ONE vehicle, with only ONE other man, HAS HIS BACK TURNED ON GRETCHEN,
      and DOES NOT HAVE HIS GUN DRAWN. And even with that, TWO MILITARY MEN COULD
      NOT HANDLE ONE STUPID SLUT?!! You don't go in to rescue a hostage without backup!!
      That's basic procedure!! What the General was supposed to do was to bring an
      entire squad of men, with AT LEAST THREE of them holding their guns to Gretchen's
      temples, and the rest entering the warehouse with their guns ready to fire in
      case of an ambush, all the while the General keeping watch on Gretchen with
      his gun drawn. This is what should have been done. While that section didn't
      make much sense, the rest of the episode was as intriguing as any of the others.

      \ episodes (Rate of change/Killing your number). The previous episode really\
      \ managed to up the bar and set up perfectly the last 2 episodes of the series.The\
      \ first episode, Rate of change was pretty good. It was really that fantastic\
      \ but it had some great moments. It was good to see Mahone have an important\
      \ role. They try to play with the character, specially his motivations. T-Bag\
      \ stole the show. Actually these 2 episodes had among the finest T-Bag moments\
      \ I've seen in a long time. T-Bag-Sara scenes were superb. It was nice to see\
      \ Sucre back as his initial send off some time back was far from satisfying.\
      \ Cool to see C-Note too.2nd episode, killing our number was pretty good too.\
      \ Again, as far the conclusion of the scylla arc is concerned, it was not that\
      \ great but satisfactory. Kellerman (finally) returned! Even tho I knew he would,\
      \ I was still like OMG! when he first appeared. Many fans (included me) would\
      \ have considered this a loose end if he hadn't come back. He was no longer\
      \ the cold blooded killer from the first 2 seasons but it was still cool. He\
      \ is the one who actually saved the day. Little underwhelming really, best thing\
      \ would have been to develop this earlier but the actor is contracted with ABC,\
      \ so they did what they could here. T-Bag was again great here in his reunion\
      \ with Sucre/C-Note. Sara kills Christina, Linc is freed, Scylla handed to UN,\
      \ everybody was exonerated and the General arrested. It was good, felt a little\
      \ rushed but it was good.So what make this series finale fantastic? What brought\
      \ the finale feeling to it? What made it unforgettable? Well the answer to this\
      \ is the closing 10 minutes of the show. It was really what mattered. To see\
      \ where those characters we loved ended 4 years later.-Alex Mahone: My favorite\
      \ character. Had a great first part of season 4. Less relevant in the 2nd half\
      \ but was well used in the finale. William Fitchner has been amazing in those\
      \ 3 seasons. I will check his future works for sure. Mahone ends up happy\N\
      with Felicia Lang, his former colleague. Quite surprising, but this makes sense\
      \ and is much more believable than him and Pam ending together. He sends a birthday\
      \ card to Pam, meaning they at least are still in contact. I'm happy they didn't\
      \ just kill him in some heroic way. Very satisfying end for Mahone.-T-Bag: Robert\
      \ Knepper was about to become a park ranger before he got the role as T-Bag.\
      \ He has been amazing. Much like Mahone, T-Bag had a great first half of season\
      \ as Cole Pfeiffer . He has been OK in the second half but amazing in the finale.\
      \ It was great to see the creepy, sadistic and evil side of Bagwell again. His\
      \ conclusion is absolutely perfect. He gets back to Fox River, in his old ways,\
      \ which brought some ole memories (Nice to see Fox River too). Perfect send\
      \ off to a great character.-Paul Kellerman. He becomes congressman. How about\
      \ that lol. Quite underwhelming until Danny Hale's widow returned and spit on\
      \ his face. Kellerman then sat in his car in reflection, realizing he can't\
      \ get rid of his past. That was excellent. Another great send off. -Don Self.\
      \ His ending was quite shocking to me. 4 years later, he ends up just like his\
      \ wife. Kinda sad but still very ironic.-The General. Poetic justice. He set\
      \ up Linc for the chair and ends right in that very chair. He was a pity in\
      \ his last moments.-Sucre/C-Note. Finally happy with their family, nice to see\
      \ this.-Linc, Michael and Sara. Well this is the \"controversial part\" for\
      \ many. Linc is happy, living with Sofia and LJ. The final moments of the series\
      \ is really moving but imo fitting and with a lot of symbolism. Michael is dead.\
      \ At the end of the episode; his son, Sara, Sucre, Linc and Mahone visits his\
      \ grave to pay tribute. Some might say, it's cruel and totally unnecessary but\
      \ I say that it was fitting. Not that Michael deserves it (far from it) but\
      \ this really shows him as a tragic character, a hero in way, who sacrificed\
      \ it all so that his loved ones are happy. And he succeeded in that. I loved\
      \ those little details they put in here. Like Michael Jr. getting a tattoo or\
      \ the Origami bird or the quote on the grave; \"Be the change you want to see\
      \ in the world\"...something Michael ended up to be in a way. All the people\
      \ at his grave where together; former junkies, killer and enemy. Everybody changed\
      \ and were together. More importantly they were all happy. Is it a happy ending??\
      \ Well it was sad and tragic but it is a happy ending in many ways. I'm happy\
      \ they didn't go Hollywood with too much of a soapy ending. The last 10 minutes\
      \ were brilliant in all aspects. Great directing, great acting, great soundtrack\N\
      .prefect.These closing moments are where the character ultimately end but still\
      \ there's 2 extra episodes to be available soon. The events will take place\

      the isolated meeting point. In Dinosaur, Nebraska, Sucre calls Maricruz, but
      Theresa tells him that her sister will travel with her to Ixtapa, Mexico."Rendevous"
      is another engaging episode, with many twists and betrayals. Geary betrays Bellick
      and now he has a despicable enemy; one of Aldo''s men is actually an agent from
      the Company. Michael is not capable of killing and Mahone highlights that this
      is the greatest difference between them. Sucre records too much information
      in Maricruz''s answering machine, and this action may bring trouble to the escapees.
      Sara apparently has not believed in Michael''s words, and now she sees who Kellerman
      indeed is. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Ponto de Encontro" ("Meeting Point")'

      and I watching it every week, at the edge of our seats. i think they should
      somehow convert this into a movie with all the same actors and actresses. this
      is the best TV show i've seen in a very long time. and Wentworth and Dominic
      are so attractive - yummy!! I can't wait to watch Monday's show. I hope they
      get away and are able to prove Lincoln's innocents. I will cry if they don't!!
      I believe that the Actors and Actress's play every role with everything they
      have. I also think Miller and Purcell are a great team, they should work together
      more often.

      and the things are getting so conclusive that I feel that there will be a ''bomb''
      in the end that will generate the plot for the 3rd Season. The cast is still
      great, and so are the characters. There''s a trap in every corner and that''s
      what keeps the show interesting: you never know who to trust. But what I can
      trust is that Alex Mahone was definitely a great idea of character for this
      season, because he is logical, intelligent and keeps the plot believable, because
      even though Lincoln is innocent, he can''t escape justice as a "escapee". Not
      much happens on this episode except for the whole plot involving Cooper Green
      that traps not only the audience but almost gets Lincoln and Michael into the
      hands of Bill Kim again. I just thought LJ could appear during a longer time,
      because after a while we expect a good return from old characters, such as Henry
      Pope last week. Despite the good episode, I COULD NOT Believe that the content
      of the tape was not revealed! I''m OK with the suspense and everything, and
      I know it keeps the audience attached to the show, but i hope they reveal it

    text: After the cliffhanger from the previous episode, 'By The Skin And Teeth'
      - in true Prison Break style, you'd have expected to tune into the latest episode
      eagerly hoping for a conclusion to the cliffhanger and how Michael and the rest
      of the escapees will battle on with the plan. That's not what you get with 'Brother's
      Keeper' - nevertheless, it doesn't disappoint and remains a personal favourite.This
      episode is set entirely out of context of the rest of the season, it takes place
      three years before Michael was ever incarcerated in Fox River, with little reference
      to the prison itself. Amongst those stories of the two brother's been told,
      we also see what led to the incarceration of Fernando Sucre, Theodore 'T-Bag'
      Bagwell and Benjamin 'C-Note' Franklin and exactly what they want from the outside
      after the escape. We also get to see how Dr. Sara Tancredi has a slightly dark
      past of her own she's kept hidden, as well as a little more of an insight in
      Captain Bellick's character.From this episode, we get see how Michael came to
      believe in his brother's innocence and give up everything to devise his brilliant
      plan to rescue him before execution. Also, watch out for designs for his tattoos
      and things Michael does that seem to have no apparent relevance in the escape
      from Fox River - these are foreboding moments for season 2 and shows how his
      tattoos also hold the key to staying on the outside.Watching the story of the
      conspiracy unfold, and exactly how The Company and the Secret Service framed
      Lincoln and pushed for the death penalty is brilliant, and it answers a lot
      of questions you still may have about it. Danny McCarthy also gets the chance
      to reprise his role as Secret Service Agent Danny Hale and we see how he and
      Kellerman have been involved in the thing from the beginning.The episode also
      includes a brief snippet from America's Most Wanted, which includes a special
      guest appearance from John Walsh.

      is amazing and makes you want to see the next. But when i knew the next one
      was the one for there escape i couldn't wait, and when it came i was blown off
      my seat. Basic story line for this episode is that Michael tapes up pope into
      a wardrobe making him call off the search for belic, they all meet in his cell
      and go into the pipes, belic nearly gets found because he scraps off the tape
      round his mouth and starts shouting for help. But the crew get there just in
      time to stop him from being found and carry on to the drain pipe. They all put
      on their white suits as Michael dressed as belic goes into the phyc ward and
      sets of the fire alarm, when all the phyc's come out, the crew come out of the
      drain pipe and blend in with the phyc's. Michael jabs the phyc ward guard with
      some shot that knocks him out, they all then leave through the phyc ward to
      the medic room. They take out the window with a hose pipe tied to the bars,
      and the other end to the lift which they send down to pull the bars off. They
      all get over the wire except db cooper who can't and stays behind, and the fat
      guy snaps the wire and gets caught because the secretary finds the pope who
      sounds the alarms. That is just a brief over run of the episode. Hope you found
      it helpful. I recommend prison break to ANYONE. Best drama ever! Can't wait
      for the final episode.

      kills him and asks if there were any further questions from the other participants.
      Lisa is shocked with the attitude of her father. Herb calls Michael believing
      that Lincoln has killed two federal agents. Self brings T-Bag seeking out Gretchen.
      Michael faints in the toilet, Lincoln helps him and Sara injects a drug and
      tells that he can not have any physical stress for eight hours. Lincoln calls
      Gretchen and tells that Self has double-crossed them and stolen Scylla. They
      schedule a meeting at the Grand Hope Park in one hour; however Gretchen''s sister
      Rita calls her with Self pointing his gun to her head. Meanwhile, Special Agent
      Richard Sooter comes for investigating the case. Gretchen arrives at her sister''s
      house and Self forces her to call the National Security and tell where Michael
      and his group are. Lincoln is arrested in the park, but the rest of the group
      escapes. Self forces Gretchen to contact a buyer (actually a conduit) called
      Viking, since there are only five potential buyers in the world. T-Bag stays
      with Rita and Emily, while Gretchen and Self go to a meeting with Viking. Meanwhile
      the truth about Self is disclosed through a deleted file in the name of Robert
      Walker, and Senator Conrad Dallow apologizes to Lincoln. He calls Michael and
      the group and the senator promises full immunity if they agree to testify against
      Self. Michael asks Mahone, Sara and Sucre to travel out of Los Angeles and he
      goes to a meeting with Herb and the senator. However, Herb and Senator Dallow
      discusses about the consequences of the unauthorized operation, meaning at least
      fifteen years in prison, and they decide to eliminate all the evidences of the
      operation. However, Michael and Lincoln are saved by Agent Sooter that kills
      Herb but discloses that he works for The Company, and brings the brothers to
      "an appointment with the General". However, Sucre appears out of the blue and
      saves Michael and Lincoln that kills Sooter, but let Senator Dallow go. The
      Senator leaves all the documents and tells that the operation has never happened.
      Meanwhile Self and Gretchen meets with Viking, but he tells that there is one
      piece missing in Scylla that Michael has secretly withdrawn. Self calls Michael
      that invites him to come and get it.When I saw "Selfless", I believed "Prison
      Break" had reached its climax. However, this sequel is spectacular, with many
      almost impossible twists and surprising situations. It is impressive how people
      are double-crossed in this series. Mahone mentions that he has a friend in FBI
      (I believe he is referring to Agent Lang) and he disappears. In my opinion,
      he traveled to meet Agent Lang, who also helped him when he was addicted with
      the picture of his son. The alternatives of any deal with Michael and his friends
      to clear their names are narrowing with the death of Herb, the negative of Senator
      Dallow and the betrayal of Self. I guess that the fates of T-Bag and Self are
      in the hands of the evil Gretchen. Let''s anxiously wait for the next Monday
      to see if Self will come to get the missing piece with Michael! My vote is ten.Title

      the whole season in 1 day. I mean, that was a blast. Made so may good memories
      "resurrect", as the name of the series suggest.Although I never found the acting
      to be perfect, I always loved T- Bag. The level of tension he brought to the
      original show was such breath taking that no so many villains managed to provide,
      not original, but an excellent psychopath. Yet they decided to make him a different
      person in the sequel. But this person was not T-bag by story, just a shadow
      of him. This was a good person, seeking justice and solace, and forgiveness,
      which are so unlike him. I can't believe they didn't give him a more demanding
      job. And the ending for him was justified weakly. Of course he killed an agent,
      but she was corrupted (as it was proved) and it was sort of self defense. They
      made the whole scene with him killing the agent just to make an excuse to put
      him back in prison for the culminating scene at the end.In addition, I can't
      believe they did not bring back Alex Mahone. I mean, he was the super smart
      brain in season 2, they could have give him at least something more than Sucre.On
      the other hand, when this season finished, I realized that not a lot of things
      are different from what they were back in 4x24. Everyone's free, T-Bag is still
      in prison, the law is good with everyone. The only difference is that this time,
      Micheal is alive and well, with his family. This makes you wonder, why couldn't
      they do this back then? Obviously they killed him before to make things more
      dramatic and heroic. Like he is a hero that should not be abounded by normal
      life. So why they decided to do it this time? We are definitely not going to
      watch him and his family live a normal life and happily ever after. Why bother

      made me upset was when David Apolskis died i really liked his character. i hope
      this show runs for plenty more seasons. Mondays really suck because its the
      beginning of the week and everyone knows how that feels, but knowing that this
      show is on kinda makes the first day of the week bearable. every show ends in
      a way that makes you can't wait till next week although i hate the long wait
      the show is definitely worth it.

    text: 'Intrigued and puzzled. Two words I consider well describe how you should
      feel after watching Prison Break''s pilot. As a teenager films like The Great
      Escape and Escape from Alcatraz fascinated me. However when it first aired I
      didn''t have any expectations as I had never heard of the show before. The first
      effect was intense, the second, this one, was even better.The very first minutes
      we''re introduced to the protagonists : Michael Scolfield, his lawyer Veronica
      Donovan and his brother Lincoln Burrows. The last is in prison but he claims
      his innocence. The first believes him and has apparently a twisted plan to help
      his brother. The second knows them since childhood but she doesn''t really know
      how to help them nor if she should trust them. This first episode arises so
      many questions that it''s impossible to list them all. Is Michael a genius or
      out of his freaking mind ? Is Lincoln innocent or guilty ? What about the other
      characters ? Indeed some were introduced and it''s obvious they''ll be involved
      in some way with Michael and the puzzle he has apparently designed and is about
      to solve. But of course things quickly don''t go as planned and it seems he''ll
      have to deal with numerous problems and dangerous characters. So the story is
      really interesting and viewers enjoying mind games should really dig it.The
      acting is also quite good, but not flawless, and the performers manage to make
      most characters grow on us. In fact some of their connections reminded me of
      Lost because you don''t really know their relationships or stories. The directing
      and production quality are also great and it really feels like Michael has found
      a new comfy home to make long time friends. But the best thing about it, knowing
      what happened next, is that the best is yet to come. So the surprising events
      that occurred in the pilot are just the tip of the iceberg. And once you have
      seen it the only thing you''ll want to do is dive into an enigmatic realm of
      chaos and manipulation.'

      happened to the previous one. It was really interesting, I wish I could see

    text: 'Directed by highly successful Hollywood producer and director, Brett Ratner,
      known for ''Rush Hour'' and ''Red Dragon'',this pilot episode entices from the
      outset. In the first three minutes alone, the unnamed protagonist has a full-body
      tattoo completed, before removing all evidence from his apartment, from the
      newspaper clippings stuck to the windows, to disposing his hard-disc drive from
      his balcony into the waters below, and then, intentionally allowing himself
      to be detained whilst committing armed robbery. Moreover, despite the seriousness
      of his situation, our protagonist ignores his attorney''s advice, and leaves
      the charges uncontested.The twists keep coming as after being incarcerated,
      his interest in the high profile death row inmate, Lincoln Burrows, convicted
      for the murder of the Vice-President''s brother, is revealed as being down to
      the fact that he is the condemned man''s younger sibling. Furthermore, the audience
      soon learns he is there to engineer his brother''s escape.With such an enthralling
      premise, one hopes that the success the writer, Paul Scheuring, has enjoyed
      since this pilot was aired, has been shared to some extent with a former female
      colleague who suggested the basic plot to him. Given the fact that aside from
      the screenplay for the Vin Diesel vehicle, ''A Man Apart'' Scheuring was an
      unknown quantity, and given the complexity of the premise, Fox were initially
      reluctant to produce the show. However, the success of ''Lost'' persuaded them
      to back the project, and they were further emboldened by Ratner''s attachment
      to the project as executive producer. The latter had become attracted first
      and foremost by the originality of the script.With him Ratner brought twice
      Oscar-nominated cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, impressing the Academy Awards
      for his work on ''LA Confidential'' and ''The Insider''. The opening episode
      of this new project was thereby provided with such a slick and stylish gloss.
      In terms of the casting process, the writer has revealed the difficulty he and
      Ratner had in casting the male lead. In fact, the show was just one week from
      production when Wentworth Miller auditioned.Miller''s previous career breakthrough
      performance had been as the young Anthony Hopkins in ''A Human Stain''. Here
      he is thoroughly convincing as the self-assured and highly intelligent structural
      engineer, Michael Scofield. The menacing atmosphere of Scofield''s new home
      at Fox River State Penitentiary is neatly summed up by his cell-mate when, after
      witnessing the latent violence of his new surroundings, the latter welcomes
      him to ''Prisneyland''.As characters emerge, the viewer at times feels the impulse
      for a necessary rewind to the clippings seen earlier on Scofield''s apartment
      window. Each character is revealed as having great relevance for Scofield, without
      us, the audience, having their precise significance for Scofield''s plans amateurishly
      ''telegraphed''. This is no more the case than with the mobster, John Abruzzi,
      unofficially in charge of the distribution of prison jobs.Needing a means to
      get access to his brother, Scofield proceeds to riskily entice Abruzzo with
      discovering the whereabouts of the squealer whose testimony had him convicted
      of a double murder. Having borne the brunt of a physical beating, Scofield is
      rewarded with a work detail alongside his brother, Burrows.Then there is the
      prison doctor, and daughter of the local governor, Sara Tancredi, who Scofield
      shamelessly flaunts with, while feigning diabetes, to access the medical facility
      for an as-yet unknown motive. The extent of our protagonist''s assuredness is
      also highlighed by his tactful handling of Stacy Keach''s prison warden to avoid
      being placed in solitary confinement in return for his assistance in answering
      the structural issues within the warden''s anniversary gift of the model of
      the Taj Mahal.The enticing mystery is not confined to the characters alone.
      Within the quick-fire opening sequence within Scofield''s apartment, the brief
      shot of an origami swan so obviously implies that this seemingly immaterial
      object will take on much greater significance in the development of the plot
      across subsequent episodes.The episode does have its flaws - principally the
      lame treatment given to the strand of the story concerning Burrows'' son. Having
      witnessed the incarceration of both his father and uncle, the latter falls off
      the rails and is arrested for attempting to sell illegal substances. What should
      come across as an empathetic understanding of the damaging effect of this loss
      of parental guidance on Burrow''s son, instead, feels much more like a convenient
      and mechanistic sub-plot. Yet, although there is an unbelievable leniency in
      terms of custodial sentencing, this sub-plot does provide the writer and the
      director an opportunity to show the murderer on death row in a familial light
      - his advice to his son carrying some weight: ''I don''t want you to love me...I
      want you to love yourself.''Aside from these minor distractions, the intricate
      plot keeps the pace brisk, with it becoming gradually evident to the audience
      that Lincoln''s claims of being framed may be true. The slaying of the bishop,
      played by Chelcie Ross, poised to offer Burrows reprieve from the chair, so
      soon after being threatened by the secret services is strongly suggestive that
      there are powerful interests wishing the truth to be buried with the man Scofield
      has come to rescue.The episode, having started with the low buzz of the tattoo
      artist''s needle, brilliantly ends with one of the best ''reveals'' within recent
      TV history. This concerns the revelation that the engineering works conducted
      at Fox Rover had been contracted out under the table to Scofield''s company,
      and he has not simply committed these to memory, but has a permanent record
      of them by means of disguising them within the tattoos on his body.'

    text: 'Sucre drills the concrete wall and introduces a micro-camera with Mahone
      to see the Scylla behind a glass wall and protected by sensitive sound and heat
      detectors. Michael''s surgery needs to be on that day, and Sara describes each
      necessary step to Michael. T-Bag takes pictures of Gretchen wearing sensual
      clothes. Krants and Lisa discuss the transportation of Scylla, but Gretchen
      sends her pictures and he leaves Lisa to meet Gretchen. However he does not
      bring his card and Gretchen fails in her intention, claiming for her life due
      to their daughter Emily. Mr. White invites T-Bag for one week cruise due to
      his brilliant speech to the Idaho group, but he refuses. Then he tells Gretchen
      that Trishanne is a federal agent and Gretchen calls Feng and tells him that
      she needs his help. Self tells Michael that Gretchen failed, but sent one additional
      page to him. Sara tells Michael that it is time to go to the hospital, but he
      refuses, asking how he could live if all die. Gretchen tells T-bag that she
      has a new buyer that offered US$ 200 million, and gives the address for the
      meeting on 1917 Piermont. Trishanne calls Self and they go to the address where
      they are surprised by Feng and his men. Michael goes with Lincoln, Sucre and
      Mahone, and Sara injects a drug for epileptic in Michael while Sucre prays for
      him. Lisa skips lunch in Eagles and Angels to meet Krantz and he summons the
      card holders for a meeting. Michael asks for absolute silence, and they build
      a bridge to reach Scylla, using nitrogen and an electromagnetic field to avoid
      the detectors, but the alarm sounds and Krantz sees Michael with Scylla.In this
      episode, the careful operation to reach Scylla apparently blows in the end.
      Or is it a trick to attract the attention and reach the sixth card? Michael
      postpones his surgery and puts his health and life in danger. Self is absolutely
      naive working with the untruthful and dangerous Gretchen and T-Bag. My vote
      is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available'

      amazing... i just cant wait to watch the next episode...first of all... there
      were some plot holes which were pretty apparent but those were made to be overseen
      by the excellent direction and execution by the actors involved...after knowing
      the next episode titled as "selfless", you only hope that someone from the team
      gives their life selflessly...Cant wait for the next episode!!!!!!

    text: This episode continued the great start that this show got off to last week.
      While I'm sure it dropped in viewership, it doesn't change the fact that this
      episode might have been better put together than the premiere. Michaels motives
      still remain quite a mystery, and his involvement with isis is very intriguing.
      We get some cool action scenes with Lincoln and C- note, but T-bags and Sucres
      absences bring the episode down a little. However, the return of fan favorite
      Paul Kellerman easily makes up for it. I am interested to see how the final
      7 episodes play out considering that every other season had at least 13 episodes
      to tell its story. This episode won't get anyone else hooked on the show, but
      it certainly won't drive viewers away either.

    text: How the hell will Michael do this time to save the day ? That's the question
      that haunted millions of fans around the world after watching the previous episode.
      Of course this one began to answer the question and it was really interesting
      to see our favorite breaker struggling. Moreover as expected he teamed up with
      Mahone but as usual things didn't go as planned and many twisted events occurred.
      The decisions they had to make reminded of Batman Foverer when the dark knight
      got trapped by Riddler, asking him to choose between Robin and Chase. Beside
      that thrilling story the direction felt really solid and all characters had
      the scenes they deserved. The true nature of the mother was revealed during
      a conversation with Lincoln. The actress overall performance is quite good and
      in this episode she managed to confirm her talent. It's fascinating to see how
      her profile contrasts with her clothing line, looking as innocent and pure as
      a white dove. Sara also got the honor of hearing T-Bag's thoughts on life and
      love. Of course it was both disturbing and funny but the greatest thing was
      that the writer referenced past events that should appeal to long time fans.
      Some minutes were also dedicated to covering the Self arc but it was only a
      minor one compared to the others. Last but not least beside the usual McGyver
      voodoo, which was really welcome this time and not over the top, there were
      some major changes in the casting. An other reason for the fans not to miss
      this great first part of the finale.

      equipment, he finds it empty and the monitors on the table; however Michael
      left an origami with a clue for him. Lincoln tells Sara that his mother had
      a brain tumor with an aneurysm and that she died when she was thirty-one year-old.
      He tells that Michael has the same age and his nose is also bleeding. Gretchen

      funny part of the show is Sucre in Scuderi''s room. Roland jeopardizes the mission
      of the group with his reckless attitude in the jack-pot gambler machine. My

      the FBI agent Mahone shot David apolskis i almost cried i don't know why they'd
      kill him off unless lane garrison didn't want to be on the show anymore i thought
      his story was really interesting plus it was more sad since he met up with that
      girl again from earlier.i'm going to be going crazy till the next show when
      they say whether or not he died it looks like he died because he was shot about
      4 times and blood was coming out of his mouth but its Hollywood anything is
      possible. it could have bin a daydream mahone was having as he was driving apolskis
      back to interigaton.i really hope he lives its a long shot. if he did die i
      hope to see lane garrison on TV more he's a really good actor. i'd rate this
      show a ten but this episode a was to sad before the end scene showing David
      getting shot it was 9.i understand killing off the governor because he knew
      to much but who would believe a 18 year old conflict with a history of lying.

      is a desperate man...Sara (his ex-wife) started a new life....T-bag is out of

      Micheal, what exactly he does in Yemen and his ignorance about his brother's
