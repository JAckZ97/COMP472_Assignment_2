    text: This show really turned to crap this season. Kinda hard to follow 3 seasons
      but this is just a flaming garbage dump. Nobody gets hit by gun fire. Storyline
      is too predictable and bad. Gretchen is a terrible character. Really sad the
      path this show took. Prisoners in jail season to expert secret spies and thieves
      haha wtf

    text: Eight hours after the escape, Michael, Lincoln, Sucre, C-Note and Abruzzi
      continue to run for their lives as Special Agent Alexander Mahone is brought
      in from the FBI to lead the search for the fugitives.Hours earlier they pulled
      off the greatest break in US history, but as many people know the greatest laid
      plans of mice and men don't always go the way they are planed. When Abruzzi's
      plane took off, they have to go with plan "B". This involves a place called
      Oswego more specifically "Ripe Chance Woods". But for all the planing Michael
      did, he did not count on Special Agent Alexander Mahone, a man who like Michael
      sees patterns where everybody else sees chaos. Meanwhile Veronica, has confronted
      Terrence Steadman(played now by Jeff Perry because John Billingsley left to
      join the cast of the series "The Nine")and discovers that he is not hiding,
      but rather a prisoner of the Blackfoot Mansion, and calls the police to report
      the president of a crime. Back in Oswego, the other fugitives mainly T-Bag,
      stole a cooler full of ice and placing his severed hand inside goes to a clinic
      to have it reattached, but unfortunately for him it's an animal hospital. Mahone
      along with Bellick and other law enforcement track them to a storage facility
      in Oswego, and while Michael and the others are inside they surround the place
      and prepare for a breach just as Lincoln opens the grate entrance. inside the
      storage locker, nothing. A dead end... and where are the fugitives, at Oswego
      cemetery, preparing to dig in the grave of E. Chance Woods, the grave marker
      reading "R.I.P, E. Chance Woods".Down in the grave, they find what was supposed
      to be a weeks worth of clothes for Michael and Lincoln, but since they are five
      of them, the clothes must be dived up. But all is not, well for genius Agent
      Mahone figured out what "Ripe Chance woods" meant. And tracked them to the cemetery.
      But they escape by infiltrating the populace of Oswego. They reach a Garage
      where Michael stashed a car, giving Lincoln a chance to call Veronica. Talking
      to him she tells Lincoln that Terrence is still alive and the police are their,
      the officer tells her to hang up the phone turning to ask him why she stares
      down the barrel of his gun BLAM BLAM BLAM!!!! on the other end of the phone,
      Lincoln collapses in tears. as the episode comes to a close the camera closes
      in on Veronica's dead body, twice in the chest once in the head, by the book
      execution.

    text: Heyo! It's Osama bin Laden. Only now he's called Abdul Ramal and he's locked
      up with Michael Scofield. Maybe Prison Break is taking it a step too far. I
      don't want to take this new season in the Prison Break series too seriously
      because then I might actually enjoy it more. But the thing is that beheadings
      and religious intolerance are not issues to be taken lightly. The second episode
      takes itself very serious with the introduction of these story lines. I'm curious
      to see where they take this series, but so far I'm not the least bit impressed.
      Show more Scofield and his Prison Break plan and show less of the dumber brother
      in the middle of simplified middle eastern conflicts.

    text: "When the previous episode had a few cons this one succeeded in rubberizing\
      \ most of them, if not all. First the Scofield brothers relationship has never\
      \ been so tense. Moreover it's not pictured as only black and white like in\
      \ so many other productions. The characters have grown on us so much in the\
      \ past seasons that watching them collide against each other is nearly fascinating.\
      \ Lincoln's flashbacks were particularly interesting and revealed how much he\
      \ loves Michael. He really thinks working for the Company is the right think\
      \ to do but now it's obvious he would never hurt Michael. He helped him to break\
      \ out so now it's his turn to save him, again. They're nearly like twins, the\
      \ sides of the same coin. We also learned more about Christina and her ambiguous\
      \ intentions. But like if it wasn't enough character development already the\
      \ writers even managed to dedicate a few emotional scenes with Sara. She brings\
      \ so much to the show and I'm glad the production took the fans seriously. So\
      \ I can't wait to learn more about their relationship. This time I was also\
      \ gladly surprised by the editing because it didn't feel as boring as last time.\
      \ Every scenes were interesting and I enjoyed every single seconds of it. Last\
      \ but not least Lincoln's team was back and that story arc was just perfect\
      \ entertainment. It was like playing one of the titles of the Hit-man video\
      \ game series : Guards to distract or kill, cameras to avoid or shoot, a door\
      \ to unlock or explode\N I let you guess if they chose the stealth or berserker\
      \ way. Moreover they made good use of their skills and their profiles are quite\
      \ original. I mean even if T-Tab is dangerous, how can you hate him ? Also thanks\
      \ to him we learned something important to anticipate the upcoming episode\N\
      Only a few episodes remain but I have never been so excited about a show. In\
      \ fact I think Prison Break will be remembered as one as the most rock solid\
      \ action show ever aired. Of course it had a few missteps but overall I think\
      \ you couldn't dream for better last episodes. The Scylla arc also manages to\
      \ link the fiction to the reality so it's hard not to believe in the story and\
      \ like its characters. I mean its events could be happening right now\N But\
      \ in which city Michael would probably ask ?"

      anonymously receives new evidences about the case while Lincoln glances to his
      father in the observation room. Judge Kessler orders the exhumation of the remains
      of Terrance Steadman based on two different records about a removed appendix.
      Lincoln asks the name of the man in the room to Warden Pope and he tells that
      he is the journalist William Prall, from the Headline Press. Michael plots another
      escape plan through the asylum using the blueprint tattooed on his body. He

      check his plan, but her burns his body on the steam piping; after a medical
      intervention, Michael finds that the part of the map with the escape route through
      the asylum is missing on his burnt back.This episode is only reasonable when
      compared with the previous ones. Steadman''s dental record was changed and the

      with his new plan. The appearance of the missing father of Lincoln and Michael

      hesitate to believe what he said about the Land Cruiser.Michael and the crew
      don't collect weapons from the died ISILs, which can be useful later.Michael
      has been a genius from season 1. But the plan he came up to get rid of the one-eyed
      man was just suicidal.The end of the episode(What Michael did) was the worst
      part of the episode. That is hundred percent unreal. It is hard to think what
      the writers were thinking.I wish if the episode was more logical and realistic.

    text: So many unexpected things happened in this episode. I think it's Prison
      Break at its best. Bellick made an unexpected choice which would surely mark
      our remembrance about him. I didn't know I would care about Bellick this much.
      I have just finished watching this episode and now I am speechless. The only
      thing that could appease any Bellick lovers is the death of Wyatt (did I spoil
      too much?). All hail Mahone! And this season will be the final one of this incredible
      series. It has run its course, I guess. I still have yet to see Michael in any
      fine suits since the first episode of the season. Gosh he's getting fatter.

    text: 'So, Prison Break ends. Sort of. More on that later. First, some very telling
      numbers. The first of which is 4.16 - the episode with original air date 22
      Dec 2008, and the first in a continuous string of episodes that I rated 2/10
      until this "final episode". However, after 4.16, the show went on a hiatus.
      Then, on 14 Jan 2009, Fox announced that the show would be ending. Which is
      just a PR-friendly euphemism for saying that the show has been canceled. And
      it was not until 17 April 2009 that the hiatus ended. What I''d really like
      to know, is what happened behind the scenes. The show had lost one third (3
      million) viewers compared to the height of its popularity during seasons 1 and
      2, so the suits'' decision to pull the plug is perfectly logical. The funny
      thing is, I can easily imagine the show-runners (producers and writers) saying
      one of General Krantz''s line in this episode: "Is this the end? Whimpering."
      And I would very much like to know what came into their mind next.The show-runners
      and the public were told there would be 6 episodes after the hiatus. So it was
      a bit like when ABC made the historical announcement that Lost would have "only"
      three seasons left after the third season, only on a smaller scale. Still, 6
      episodes is enough to exit either with a bang or a whimper. Sadly, we got the
      latter. Not that it would be apparent from the high IMDb ratings for the last
      six episodes - ranging from 7.6 to 8.8 for this very episode. But one has to
      remember, the voters come from the pool of those people who did *not* stop watching
      the show when it became both absurdly stupid and stupidly absurd. And the number
      of voters for the post-hiatus episodes averages a bit over 300 - not a reliable
      sample. The whimper would also not be apparent from the gushing reviews that
      have been voted most useful. But the usefulness of the reviews has been voted
      by about a dozen people - not a reliable sample either. Also, which one is more
      likely to write a gushing review: a person who did already waste 1 hour of their
      life watching this garbage or a person who is so enamored by the show that they
      have no objectivity? And which one is more likely to vote on the usefulness
      of a review, let alone read one? Back to the show-runners. It''s pretty apparent
      that they gave up, but at times during these six episodes, it almost felt like
      they were trying to joke about the absurdity of the show. *Almost.* Still, that
      thought did cross my mind when Mahone had a fit and yelled, "This is crap!"
      And when Lincoln pondered, "How stupid am I to end up framed *twice* for a high-level
      assassination?" But then, for this grand finale, they resurrected Kellerman,
      last seen shot full of holes at the end of season 2 because he had betrayed
      The Company. And they played the resurrection straight-faced. Are we to believe
      he was shot with rubber bullets? Or blanks? Or that that the hit-men missed?
      There is *no* frakkin'' way for a logic explanation for how that execution was
      not a real execution. The one Kellerman gives us is just ret-con BS. Then there
      is the unnecessary number of players at endgame. They serve no purpose other
      than to stretch things to fill the running time. Also, it is pathetic to write
      *three* questioning/torturing/leveraging segments that are interlaced. That''s
      one idea used three times at the same time! Again, no purpose other than to
      fill the running time. All this presumably to make sure there would be no time
      to explain what happened during the four years that are skipped before the final
      segment. Because - and this is the "sort of ends" part - people would have to
      *pay for* the straight-to-DVD "The Final Escape" to see what happened. So, nice-looking
      ending segment or not, this really is a whimper. 1/10.'

      this one... but i must admit that it is somewhat a disappointment... am an ardent
      fan of prison break and despite it's loopholes, i still continued to love it
      because of it's twists and the unexpectedness... but i just feel it has lost
      it's way or rather it's losing it's way... to start with... the General having
      found that Michael has got his hands on the Scylla, he asked for a team to come
      down to tat place... but strangely there were only 2 men... having heard of
      how shrewd Michael is, i guess the general missed the plot here... we have seen
      how shrewd the general himself could be... tat was not totally satisfactory...
      he gave up a bit too easily...anyway... still it had it's share of thrill rides
      but not as good as how it used to be... and it was so predictable that there
      would be more chase by the way all of em were talking at the end of the episode...to
      add to that another twist with Don Self... well... i guess he might join hands
      with T-Bag... Now, the rest of the storyline is pretty easily have become predictable
      with only 4 more episodes to go...I only hope the creators would give a grand
      ending to what could be considered as one of the finest TV series...Looking

      it should be served with a side order of macaroni.Yeah- Nah. It just, wasn't
      good. The idea itself is great, but there are huge gaps in the story (how was
      Sarah allowed back into the USA if she's a fugitive? T-Bag killed like a trillion
      people and escaped from THREE DIFFERENT PRISONS. How is he just being released
      after only serving seven years?).On a more positive note, I really like the
      new intro sequence. It fits in really well with the others, and helps season
      five really stand out versus the others.Whatever man. I'll be watching next
      week, I'm too far deep to quit now.

      the tunnel, the quartet breaks-out Sona, meeting with Lincoln on the beach,
      where Whistler notes that he lost the book with the coordinates. They use breathing
      apparatuses and swim underwater to a buoy, waiting for Sucre. However their
      fellow is cuffed to a file drawer in Sona. But McGrady''s father finds the boat
      312 moored in the marina and he rescues the escapees. McGrady follows with his
      father, while the car of Lincoln and the fugitives is chased by Gretchen''s
      men. However they find the GPS in Whistler''s watch and they lure the gangsters
      in a shootout later. When Sucre is released in Sona, T-Bag sees him and discloses
      his identity to the guards. Meanwhile, Mahone says goodbye and Whistler escapes
      from Michael and Lincoln, leaving them with nothing for a negotiation with Gretchen.The
      escape of Michael and the other inmates, luring the scumbags, is the engaging
      part of this show. However, the attitude of Whistler leaving the brothers and
      not having the coordinates by heart is disappointing. The coincidence of T-Bag
      seeing Sucre in Sona during the torture session is also a forced situation.

      would finally tie up all the important loose ends and that is what I got.Honestly,
      I would say this episode is not as good as the previous and definitely is not
      one of the best episodes of Prison Break, but what it is... is the finale that
      Prison Break should have had a long time ago. Take for example Breaking Bad
      a series in which the character that turns evil dies at the end. Fitting right?
      For a guy who committed so many crimes to finally pay after getting a somewhat
      redemption. Well as fitting as it is for that show, that''s how much unfitting(couldn''t
      find any other word) was for this show to kill the character at the end. Many
      questions were raised like: How Michael''s tumor came back? Why he would willingly
      kill himself because his tumor came back?(I mean he could have lived for years)
      yet his mum who had a similar condition lived after surgery... well this episode
      is what that ending should have been. I''m not saying it''s the perfect finale
      but it does have some awesome Prison Break moments like: "Truth is whatever
      you tell people it is" or a moment at a warehouse in which I for one couldn''t
      keep up with the mind games and who was doing what was supposed to anymore.
      And above all we have some of the best Michael moments put in Prison Break that
      reminded me of why I liked this show so much. There are twists and revelations
      and moments that will surprise you just as long as you don''t expect this to
      be the "Greatest Finale Ever" but just the finale that we deserved 7 years ago.In
      conclusion I''ll say this once more: This episode is a fitting end to this show
      and one that tied up very nicely all the loose ends that were raised during
      this season and during the final episode of season 4. Seeing this rated with
      8,7(at this moment) on IMDb is a little disrespectful and I guess it''s only
      because we were expecting some of it and the episode wasn''t as artistic as
      the previous one. But in the end all good things and bad things must come to
      the end!'

      there are some elements that indicate that this season is going to be far away
      from the quality of season 1... let's see!The action during the episode is nevertheless
      intensive. But, opposite to other seasons, it seems that the script is not fully
      thought throughout beforehand. Watching season 1 and 2 one had the feeling that
      everything is leading to a big point, however season 4 begins with much less
      sense of inner logic.A good side is that most of the main characters (Linc,
      Mikel, etc) are again in the move, so one can expect a lot of good moments coming.

      She asks him to dump the MP-5s in the garbage container and then she draws a
      pistol to kill T-Bag; however Trishanne arrives and saves T-Bag. When she arrests
      T-Bag, she identifies herself as FBI Agent Miriam Holtz. General Krantz threatens
      Michael and the group and he tells that the Michael and Lincoln''s father was
      not a data analyst but an executioner of The Company. They leave The Company
      in an armored truck, Michael calls Self and they head to the meeting point,
      chased by many cars. When they arrive in the airport, they are followed by The
      Company''s agents but Michael lures the agents that are arrested by the security
      of the airport. Meanwhile the bodyguards break in the toilet and find Liza tied
      on a flush toilet; she is released and calls Krantz. Sucre and Mahone keep the
      Scylla and they deliver the aimed object to Self. The agent gives an envelope
      to Michael with the documents necessary to clear their records and he asks the
      group to wait for Agent Schmidt that would be coming with vans and an ambulance.
      After one hour, Michael calls Self and get no answer. When Michael opens the
      envelope, there are only blank sheets. Meanwhile Self shoots Miriam on the chest
      and T-Bag witnesses the crime."Selfless" is the best episode of the Fourth Season
      of "Prison Break" so far. The engaging story has many twists and revelations
      and a surprising betrayal. My guess in the last episode was right, with Michael
      bringing General Krantz to the Scylla room to get the sixth card. The relationship
      between Krantz and Liza was a great surprise for me. But the betrayal of Self
      was totally unexpected for me. I regret the fate of Trishanne, a.k.a. Miriam
      Holtz, since I liked her character. General Krantz losing his arrogance and
      self-confidence is another great moment of this show. The book Michael left
      in his backpack ("All''s Well That Ends Well") is a play by William Shakespeare
      that comes from the proverb "All''s well that ends well", which means that problems
      do not matter so long as the outcome is good. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil):

      \ impression as ill-fated Leticia Barri, whose trust in our crusading lawyer\
      \ leads to her capture and silencing in a backwoods execution. The carrying\
      \ out of this callous act reveals a growing divide between our two conspiratorial\
      \ agents in terms of just how much colder Kellerman is compared to Hale in being\
      \ able to dispose of Barris. Before her disappearance, Letitia does reveal to\

      Another psychotic performance by the insane cell mate and it was good to see

      most satisfying episode to date and one of the best of this resurrection series.
      Here's my report:This episode was the one with the most revelations up until
      now. The story that Michael tells Linc is one I'd expect since Sara was not
      legally free at the end of season 4. But what I didn't like was that this episode
      made Kellerman useless in the season 4 end. Michael says Poseidon told him that
      Kellerman didn't have the "authority" to exonerate their crimes, but this might
      be just a lie told by Poseidon... we can all interpret as we each want. What
      I did like was the fact that among his story he finally said that all this was
      in order to make Sarah and Linc free, which makes a lot of sense and fill in
      a lot of the holes the season 4 finale had. The rest of the episode is basic
      Prison Break manhunt with the group trying to get away from ISIL after killing
      their leader. Jacob does something that surprised and intrigued me for the rest
      of this season with him catching those two henchmen. Overall this is a very
      satisfying episode and as a fan I'm sure that anyone could enjoy because this
      is what the fans wanted for so long. The only thing that I didn't like was that
      part of the revelation of Michael. In the end I'd say this is one of the best
      episodes of this resurrection series and makes up for the series 4 dreadful
      finale.

      I have no idea where we left off, so let's all recap together, Sarah is in the
      wind. Sucre got away. C-Note has gone mad and gotten his wife, Kacee arrested.
      T-Bag has gone madder and is tracking down his would-be victim from the past.
      Bellick is in jail. Linc & Michael have been saved by Kellerman and Mahone has
      been shot. OK good.Tonight begins the reconstruction of the original plan that
      Michael had started. Kellerman is able to convince the brothers that he has
      flipped and is working against President Reynolds. There is no question about
      that when Kellerman kills two agents who were guarding Terrence Steadman. Now
      he and the duo of escapees shack up in a motel with Kellerman and wait it out.
      That becomes a bigger problem then we would think.Michael begins to stress about
      being so close to releasing the truth to the world and makes that ever so important
      decision to turn himself in to the news papers. But Steadman is able to snatch
      a gun and takes the selfish way out, all over the pretty painting. He is now
      just a John Doe and it is one of the final nails in the coffin for the escaped
      cons because Steadman being alive is of course the one thing that could prove
      Linc didn't kill him. Confused? Good! So good luck getting out of this one guys.
      Anyways a long way away we have T-Bag re-acquainting himself with Susan Hollander
      and her family. Lets hope family antics don't turn this show into a comedy because
      the fact that getting the $5 Million was the first thing on his list of to-do's
      before getting even with Susan seems a little odd to me. If you're a crazy who
      has a bizarre vendetta then why are plotting to steal bundles of cash first?
      But that's not the only storyline gone arouse. C-Note does not have a leg to
      stand on. He was able to get his wife and kid away from the police scramble
      that he put his homies through but now there is know where to go and the kid
      is asking why her mother was picked up by the cops. Nice hole you're in bud.Its
      nice to have the show back. I got hooked on 24 this season and now I'm in that
      mode where every episode should be an hour of the whole season. But that's OK
      because Prison Break does move quickly. One of my problems though, is that almost
      every commercial break has a cliffhanger that is more than likely a gun being
      pointed at someone. I think that we need a little more resolution so we can
      really care about the other situations going on. But they are still doing a
      good job.Read this review with all the links and others at www.MikeonTV.com

      plane, the phonebooth where Sara was standing, the handcufs, the train.), the
      fighting and the brothers back together.This episode had that feel of "Are they
      going to make it". That was the same feeling I had before they escaped Fox River.
      It's that sitting on the edge of your seat, not wanting to miss a second of

      focus almost entirely on the action happening in the middle east. Without spending
      time on the Sarah plot, this episode was much more engaging and fast-paced.
      It was an exciting chase episode, shot on nice locations. With the group of
      characters on the run getting smaller, as a viewer you become more invested
      in them. Although the characters act pretty stupid and make poor decisions,
      due to the current quality of the current Prison Break, it didn't bother me
      much.The Poseidon stuff is still a little bit lame and corny though. And some
      of the dialogue feels really forced and corny. It probably has also to do with
      the fact that the two poseidon agents are being played by not-so-convincing
      actors.But overall I enjoyed myself for 40 minutes. But I won't deny that it
      all feels a bit sloppy and aimless.

      was lost by season 3, and on season 4, I''ve rated every episode 4/10 because
      of the following reasons: 1) It''s all complete bull**** now, 2) It''s hard
      to care about the characters when everything is based on bull****, and 3) the
      tension just isn''t there anymore because by now you should have realized that
      the writers can come up with plot twists so idiotic, illogical and actually
      impossible that the next deus ex machina is always just waiting behind the corner
      (or in this case, a commercial break or the wait until the next episode).This
      episode, however, gets a 2/10. The stupidity hits an all-time low: having no
      original ideas, the writers rip off the Langley sequence from De Palma''s Mission
      Impossible, only adding thermometers to the security system. There''s even a
      fumble by Sucre, just like Tom Cruise had in the movie, for crying out loud!
      The two most stupid things here are: 1) Michael carrying out the break-in while
      in unstable health condition. Any sensible human being would realize that his
      condition seriously raises the risk of failure, and when he has a seizure (or
      whatever) on the bridge, you want to shoot the writers. 2) The General''s camera.
      Why the hell is it not *always* on? If there is a camera, any sensible user
      with access to it would always keep it on. It matters not whether Michael is
      aware of the alarm and the camera or not, since the decision to use the monitor
      rests on the general. Is the Big Bad of the Company really so stupid he doesn''t
      monitor the room? The writers sure seem to think they can make us buy such a
      ludicrous idea.The only thing preventing me from giving this a 1/10 is the fact
      that it *could* be worse. The production values could be lower, for instance,
      but as everyone who''s seen, let''s say, The Blair Witch Project, Clerks. or
      Paranormal Activity, knows that production values are just the icing on the
      cake. There have been way too many $100 to $250 million dollar movies that are
      complete bull**** because no-one bothered to write a proper script. Sadly, it
      seems that on the average, writers have not learned from their mistakes. But
      hey, who needs sense when you can make money without?'

      a little worry for the brothers. Then he told him Kellerman was the man pulling
      strings and it didn't reassure me at all. All along it was really hard to anticipate
      things and as usual the writers played with our mind. Moreover T-Bag was in
      big trouble considering he failed to prevent the knight from saving the damsel
      in distress. So he tried his best not to be killed and convince the General
      that he was still a useful asset. One of his scene with other characters should
      even make laugh out loud. In fact I think our feelings are mesmerized because
      we know it's the last episode ever.But this episode was also about rescuing
      Lincoln. Mahone continued as planned but as expected dealing with the mother
      wasn't easy. So Scylla continued its puzzling dance like a ship caught in a
      storm. Waves after waves the characters struggled to get their hands on it but
      finally the story ended. The fight was finally over and the decisions that had
      to be made weren't easy to take. But of course the most interesting thing wasn't
      actually the Scylla arc but what happened to the people revolving around it,
      like planets around a sun. Again the direction and editing were flawless and
      each character had a scene dedicated to covering its "after Scylla life". Watching
      these scenes you should have conflicted feelings because it's not all black
      and white, like in wars there have been many casualties during these four seasons.
      The important thing is that the end is smart and done the right way. I even
      see it as a TV show model for future productions. The very last scene also managed
      to bring back so many memories that it's nearly impossible to put in words how
      great it is. I can only compare it to the end of Forrest Gump, when the feather

      fourth episode, and the first of fifteen to be written by co- executive producer,
      and former writer and producer of ''NYPD Blue'', Matt Olmstead, opens with a
      wonderful tension-filled sequence as the audience share Lincoln''s nightmare
      of being woken unexpectedly and taken to execution without having had time to
      prepare. Though originally considered too handsome by the show''s creator to
      portray this rugged individual, the Australian actor, Dominic Purcell, in this
      scene illustrates perfectly his suitability for the role. A former classmate
      at drama college with Hugh Jackman, Purcell was previously known in the States
      for his role as the savant with no past in the Fox series ''John Doe'', before
      landing this plum role as Death Row inmate, Lincoln Burrows. It is at Lincoln''s
      suggestion that his former girlfriend, and now attorney, consult ''Project Justice'',
      an organisation established to aid those wrongly convicted, about his case.
      Given the lack of evidence to support his plea, the organisation decides it
      must devote its meagre resources to more deserving cases. Step forward, too-good-to-be-true,
      Nick Savarin, one of the lawyers employed by ''Project Justice'', played by
      Frank Grillo. He is drawn to Veronica''s crusade by the uncommonly precipitate
      nature with which Lincoln''s appeals have been rejected, and by Savarin''s experience
      of his own father''s having served a long sentence for a crime he didn''t commit.
      The main thrust of this episode, however, concerns the threat to Scofield''s
      plans posed by his new cell-mate, ''Haywire'', recently released from psych-ward.
      Imprisoned for killing his own parents, he suffers from a schizoaffective disorder,
      together with an inability to sleep. Not only does his presence prevent Scofield
      from tunneling out of his cell, but ''Haywire''s fascination with his tattoos
      could compromise the whole escape plan. For this and other episodes where we
      witness Scofield''s full-body markings, Miller had to spend four and a half
      hours in make-up, while their design was the work of tattoo artist, Tom Berg,
      who Brett Ratner brought to the project after his work for him on 2002''s ''Red
      Dragon''. The future star of ''Grimm'', Silas Weir Mitchell, who had originally
      auditioned for the role of ''T-Bag'', brings a real sense of menace to his performance.
      As Scofield is increasingly compelled to act to meet his deadline and avoid
      retribution from Abruzzi, the writer cleverly weaves into the narrative several
      indicators that the eponymous poison will be employed in a desperate ploy to
      rid himself of ''Haywire''s'' unwanted attentions. Yet, once he has self- inflicted
      an injury to achieve this aim, the true practical use of the chemical composition
      hidden within the markings of his tattoo is revealed. With Sucre''s return,
      now committed to the intended escape as a consequence of his rival''s moves
      on his girlfriend, and progress finally made in breaking through the back of
      their cell, the audience are made aware of a far more serious, impending threat
      to the plan''s success. In their ongoing attempts to derail Vernica''s investigations
      into Lincoln''s case, the sinister secret service team unveil Scofield''s true
      identity as Burrow''s brother. Consequently plans are afoot for his immediate
      transfer out of Fox River.'

    text: This episode was undeniably awesome, just like all the Prison Break episodes,
      some on different scales than others, of course. The only thing I didn't like,
      and that didn't make much sense, was how General Zavala, Panama's most recognized
      military figure--who managed to bring down the criminal empire of someone like
      Lechero and put him away for life--would be so careless as to not take the proper
      security measures when attempting to rescue LJ. I really liked the General as
      a character--even though is depicted as ruthless and hard, he clearly has a
      softer side and has his intentions on the right track. He and his men apprehend
      Susan B. Anthony/Gretchen Morgan, and bring her in for questioning. Though she
      initially denies any involvement in the escape, General Zavala and his men torture
      her via waterboarding and, even though she's still in denial, ironically they
      can easily surmise her guilt by the fact that she was able to withstand the
      torture--a clear sign that she had been through it before. Afterwards, when
      Whistler identifies her as the woman pulling the strings, she admits that she
      has LJ and tells the General "where", though she denies involvement in the escape.
      What did not make much sense was that the General didn't take the necessary
      precautions, especially someone as experienced as he was. He goes to the site
      with only ONE vehicle, with only ONE other man, HAS HIS BACK TURNED ON GRETCHEN,
      and DOES NOT HAVE HIS GUN DRAWN. And even with that, TWO MILITARY MEN COULD
      NOT HANDLE ONE STUPID SLUT?!! You don't go in to rescue a hostage without backup!!
      That's basic procedure!! What the General was supposed to do was to bring an
      entire squad of men, with AT LEAST THREE of them holding their guns to Gretchen's
      temples, and the rest entering the warehouse with their guns ready to fire in
      case of an ambush, all the while the General keeping watch on Gretchen with
      his gun drawn. This is what should have been done. While that section didn't
      make much sense, the rest of the episode was as intriguing as any of the others.

    text: I've reviewed quite a few season 4 episodes of Prison Break, yet the show's
      astonishing stupidity compels me to write a new one something like every other
      week. Because it really is coming dangerously close to being the Batman & Robin
      equivalent of TV strictly in terms of quality and entertainment value (the latter
      being a matter of opinion, of course). Again, no wonder the show died in USA
      and here in Finland they waited a whole year after the end of season 3 to dump
      this load on us.It's now pointless to kick this show about its plot holes since
      it seems to consist only of plot holes. And the "plotting" seems to follow the
      6-year old child's play logic of "and then they could..." - except that the
      6-year old could probably come up with a more coherent plot. The characters,
      meanwhile, are reduced to two-dimensional cardboard (remember, "one-dimensional"
      is only a straight line) with no consistent motivation and the only purpose
      of existence the needs of the writers to put boring exposition into their mouths
      and serve us "twists" according to the writers' whims.Since there were three
      pre-existing reviews more favorable than mine, I thought it only fair to see
      how they justified their ratings. One showed sarcasm and stated that "Fortunately
      this series is coming to an end" yet gave the episode 7/10. A bit high, since
      a 7 means that something is above the average of 5.5 - and this certainly isn't.
      Another reviewer had some trouble with the English language but I gathered that
      the amount of twists and cliffhangers made this worth a 9. Unfortunately their
      gushing review and declaration of love for the show reveal that they have lost
      all objectivity when reviewing this series. Again, it is important to note that
      the first third or so of season 1 was genuinely fantastic, but turning a blind
      eye to the show's later faults is not something I can do. The third reviewer
      noted that the brothers' relationship was "further developed". In what sense,
      I wonder? The only new thing was the "twist" in their relationship and that
      came straight from the bottom of the barrel. I also wonder why they thought
      that the Scylla arc was "very interesting" and couldn't help but laugh when
      they noted that the writing was "nearly fascinating". *Nearly*? And they gave
      10/10! I wonder what they would have given had the writing been "thoroughly
      fascinating" - 11/10 perhaps? Really, it seems that outside of the Twilight
      fan-base, this series had the most deluded fan-base in the world. Interesting
      though that there were no American reviews. Again, my vote is 2/10.

    text: I've been hooked on prison break since the beginning and every single episode
      is amazing and makes you want to see the next. But when i knew the next one
      was the one for there escape i couldn't wait, and when it came i was blown off
      my seat. Basic story line for this episode is that Michael tapes up pope into
      a wardrobe making him call off the search for belic, they all meet in his cell
      and go into the pipes, belic nearly gets found because he scraps off the tape
      round his mouth and starts shouting for help. But the crew get there just in
      time to stop him from being found and carry on to the drain pipe. They all put
      on their white suits as Michael dressed as belic goes into the phyc ward and
      sets of the fire alarm, when all the phyc's come out, the crew come out of the
      drain pipe and blend in with the phyc's. Michael jabs the phyc ward guard with
      some shot that knocks him out, they all then leave through the phyc ward to
      the medic room. They take out the window with a hose pipe tied to the bars,
      and the other end to the lift which they send down to pull the bars off. They
      all get over the wire except db cooper who can't and stays behind, and the fat
      guy snaps the wire and gets caught because the secretary finds the pope who
      sounds the alarms. That is just a brief over run of the episode. Hope you found
      it helpful. I recommend prison break to ANYONE. Best drama ever! Can't wait
      for the final episode.

      Lincoln has killed Miriam and simulates that he was also shot by Lincoln. The

      board of The Company, he is questioned by Howard Scuderi and he unexpectedly
      kills him and asks if there were any further questions from the other participants.
      Lisa is shocked with the attitude of her father. Herb calls Michael believing
      that Lincoln has killed two federal agents. Self brings T-Bag seeking out Gretchen.
      Michael faints in the toilet, Lincoln helps him and Sara injects a drug and
      tells that he can not have any physical stress for eight hours. Lincoln calls
      Gretchen and tells that Self has double-crossed them and stolen Scylla. They
      schedule a meeting at the Grand Hope Park in one hour; however Gretchen''s sister
      Rita calls her with Self pointing his gun to her head. Meanwhile, Special Agent
      Richard Sooter comes for investigating the case. Gretchen arrives at her sister''s
      house and Self forces her to call the National Security and tell where Michael
      and his group are. Lincoln is arrested in the park, but the rest of the group
      escapes. Self forces Gretchen to contact a buyer (actually a conduit) called
      Viking, since there are only five potential buyers in the world. T-Bag stays
      with Rita and Emily, while Gretchen and Self go to a meeting with Viking. Meanwhile
      the truth about Self is disclosed through a deleted file in the name of Robert
      Walker, and Senator Conrad Dallow apologizes to Lincoln. He calls Michael and
      the group and the senator promises full immunity if they agree to testify against
      Self. Michael asks Mahone, Sara and Sucre to travel out of Los Angeles and he
      goes to a meeting with Herb and the senator. However, Herb and Senator Dallow
      discusses about the consequences of the unauthorized operation, meaning at least
      fifteen years in prison, and they decide to eliminate all the evidences of the
      operation. However, Michael and Lincoln are saved by Agent Sooter that kills
      Herb but discloses that he works for The Company, and brings the brothers to
      "an appointment with the General". However, Sucre appears out of the blue and
      saves Michael and Lincoln that kills Sooter, but let Senator Dallow go. The
      Senator leaves all the documents and tells that the operation has never happened.
      Meanwhile Self and Gretchen meets with Viking, but he tells that there is one
      piece missing in Scylla that Michael has secretly withdrawn. Self calls Michael
      that invites him to come and get it.When I saw "Selfless", I believed "Prison
      Break" had reached its climax. However, this sequel is spectacular, with many
      almost impossible twists and surprising situations. It is impressive how people
      are double-crossed in this series. Mahone mentions that he has a friend in FBI
      (I believe he is referring to Agent Lang) and he disappears. In my opinion,
      he traveled to meet Agent Lang, who also helped him when he was addicted with
      the picture of his son. The alternatives of any deal with Michael and his friends
      to clear their names are narrowing with the death of Herb, the negative of Senator
      Dallow and the betrayal of Self. I guess that the fates of T-Bag and Self are
      in the hands of the evil Gretchen. Let''s anxiously wait for the next Monday
      to see if Self will come to get the missing piece with Michael! My vote is ten.Title

    text: I decided to see this show to the end because I refuse to let its monumental
      stupidity break me like most of the people I know who used to watch the show
      but gave up. Now Michael and Lincoln's mother is suddenly alive (her having
      been dead from the start of the series was a lie, you see) and has a plan for
      Scylla. Why am I not surprised? This makes just about as much sense as anything
      else since season 2. Clandestine warfare inside the company? Please. It's about
      as clandestine as 9/11. Since the actual purpose of Scylla isn't all that exciting
      (WHY?), the writers really are throwing everything at the wall, hoping that
      something would stick. Everything keeps changing for no plausible reason and
      results in more pointless running in circles.Actually, there was potential for
      interesting character exploration in Gretchen, but, not recognizing a chance
      when they accidentally create one, the writers stupidly (seemly) kill her off.
      Since she isn't even allowed a death scene nor a capture scene, I can only prophecize
      that she will be seen again, as a "surprise twist". Probably another one which
      will not make sense. She deserved better. Also, since Amaury Nolasco is credited
      in the opening titles as a series regular, we'll probably see him too later
      on. The writers just didn't have any use for his character after this dumb A-Team
      rip-off (more like F-team) began.At this point, the series is so bad, it does
      not even get me infuriated like earlier, when it seemed that the pieces might
      actually make some sense when put together. But since the writers have been
      making pieces up for the past three years, no way in hell will this make any
      sense when watched from beginning of season 1 to the end. Which is really a
      shame because had this remained the 13-episode miniseries as originally planned,
      it would have been *gold*. The first third of season 1 is *really* good. This
      final season is a disgrace to the name and intent of the series original plan.
      What prison? What break? And if someone tries to argue that the "prison break"
      is used as a metaphor at this point, they are seriously deluded. This will end
      in the same kind of senseless embarrassment as "The X Files" (and that was gold
      too for maybe the first three seasons). My vote is 2/10.

      the whole season in 1 day. I mean, that was a blast. Made so may good memories
      "resurrect", as the name of the series suggest.Although I never found the acting
      to be perfect, I always loved T- Bag. The level of tension he brought to the
      original show was such breath taking that no so many villains managed to provide,
      not original, but an excellent psychopath. Yet they decided to make him a different
      person in the sequel. But this person was not T-bag by story, just a shadow
      of him. This was a good person, seeking justice and solace, and forgiveness,
      which are so unlike him. I can't believe they didn't give him a more demanding
      job. And the ending for him was justified weakly. Of course he killed an agent,
      but she was corrupted (as it was proved) and it was sort of self defense. They
      made the whole scene with him killing the agent just to make an excuse to put
      him back in prison for the culminating scene at the end.In addition, I can't
      believe they did not bring back Alex Mahone. I mean, he was the super smart
      brain in season 2, they could have give him at least something more than Sucre.On
      the other hand, when this season finished, I realized that not a lot of things
      are different from what they were back in 4x24. Everyone's free, T-Bag is still
      in prison, the law is good with everyone. The only difference is that this time,
      Micheal is alive and well, with his family. This makes you wonder, why couldn't
      they do this back then? Obviously they killed him before to make things more
      dramatic and heroic. Like he is a hero that should not be abounded by normal
      life. So why they decided to do it this time? We are definitely not going to
      watch him and his family live a normal life and happily ever after. Why bother

      feel after watching Prison Break''s pilot. As a teenager films like The Great
      Escape and Escape from Alcatraz fascinated me. However when it first aired I
      didn''t have any expectations as I had never heard of the show before. The first
      effect was intense, the second, this one, was even better.The very first minutes
      we''re introduced to the protagonists : Michael Scolfield, his lawyer Veronica
      Donovan and his brother Lincoln Burrows. The last is in prison but he claims
      his innocence. The first believes him and has apparently a twisted plan to help
      his brother. The second knows them since childhood but she doesn''t really know
      how to help them nor if she should trust them. This first episode arises so
      many questions that it''s impossible to list them all. Is Michael a genius or
      out of his freaking mind ? Is Lincoln innocent or guilty ? What about the other
      characters ? Indeed some were introduced and it''s obvious they''ll be involved
      in some way with Michael and the puzzle he has apparently designed and is about
      to solve. But of course things quickly don''t go as planned and it seems he''ll
      have to deal with numerous problems and dangerous characters. So the story is
      really interesting and viewers enjoying mind games should really dig it.The
      acting is also quite good, but not flawless, and the performers manage to make
      most characters grow on us. In fact some of their connections reminded me of
      Lost because you don''t really know their relationships or stories. The directing
      and production quality are also great and it really feels like Michael has found
      a new comfy home to make long time friends. But the best thing about it, knowing
      what happened next, is that the best is yet to come. So the surprising events
      that occurred in the pilot are just the tip of the iceberg. And once you have
      seen it the only thing you''ll want to do is dive into an enigmatic realm of
      chaos and manipulation.'

      been 8 years since 2009, and although Prison Break was a breakthrough in TV,
      a lot has changed and along came many other TV series that raised the bar and
      gave us better writing and storytelling... Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, House

      must have a had a significant revamp to it to make it 2017 ready... 5 minutes
      into the episode i realized that nothing has changed.Attn: Spoiler Alert While
      in many cases, being loyal to the storytelling style is praised, in this case
      not so much. The dialogue, background music and the lack of human emotion is
      just a few of the things that made it look old, stale and very boring.Some plot
      holes might be answered at later stages and it''s early to judge by just the
      first episode, such as how is Sara living in the New York suburban family life
      when we last saw her as a fugitive.However what bothers me the most is the fast
      pace that all the events took place in the first episode all at once rather
      than introduce these back to the audience slowly and in a clever way.. it made
      it all look very sloppy.Time will tell if the show will have that same success

      Season of Prison Break. Unfortunately the episode ends in the climax, with tension
      in most of the segments. The cold blood of Abruzzi amputating the hand of T-Bag
      is impressive. The evilness of Vice President Caroline Reynolds is also amazing.
      The fictional Company has many similarities in the real world. The corruption
      and injustice in Fix River are also very realistic. I feel sorry for DB and
      for the sweet Dr. Sara Tancredi, one of my favorite characters in this series.
      The fate of Veronica after her dangerous discovery is intriguing. LJ has been
      forgotten in the last episodes. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "A Reta Final"

      is so mysterious and weird. It''s weird seeing Lincoln doing so much brain work
      and I am really sorry to see Michael in such a savage place. Every second I
      was watching a scene with that prison, madness was my only thought.Killing Sara
      was the worst thing to do, but also that means there are going to be many more
      seasons. I say that because Michael has to heel from Sara''s loss and also I
      presume they will eventually find another love interest for him. But still,
      even though Sarah Wayne Callies gave birth in July, she could have returned.
      And if she couldn''t they could hire another actress. (I saw once in a TV show
      that they switched actresses, in the middle of the season because something
      happened to the previous one. It was really interesting, I wish I could see
      that again)Also, there might be some more surprises, if the show is cleverly
      made, we saw some men shooting in Kellerman''s van when he got transported to
      prison, but it wasn''t shown exactly that he was killed. If I remember right
      there were 3 gunshots, but it doesn''t mean necessarily that Kellerman was shot.My
      interest is still on Michael though, because he is supposed to be literally
      a genius, but most of the time, he didn''t acted just like that.The reason I
      watch this show is because it contains all the reasons for which I hate the
      world: crime, injustice, all those things that I consider just to low.That only
      thing that keeps this show on top is called SUSPENSE.'

      during it's new run I was engaged in what happened. It was fast-paced, well
      edited and the story gave us a couple of twist I did not expect to happen (so
      soon in the season). I'm a bit worried that they will go all out with the conspiracy
      crap (Poseidon) and I really hope it doesn't become a fast repeat of that A-team
      bullshit from the fourth season. Because we're already out of the prison, the
      show has lost it's most interesting concept pretty fast without using it to
      their advantage for an engaging story. Overall a decent thrilling episode and

      that haunted millions of fans around the world after watching the previous episode.
      Of course this one began to answer the question and it was really interesting
      to see our favorite breaker struggling. Moreover as expected he teamed up with
      Mahone but as usual things didn't go as planned and many twisted events occurred.
      The decisions they had to make reminded of Batman Foverer when the dark knight
      got trapped by Riddler, asking him to choose between Robin and Chase. Beside
      that thrilling story the direction felt really solid and all characters had
      the scenes they deserved. The true nature of the mother was revealed during
      a conversation with Lincoln. The actress overall performance is quite good and
      in this episode she managed to confirm her talent. It's fascinating to see how
      her profile contrasts with her clothing line, looking as innocent and pure as
      a white dove. Sara also got the honor of hearing T-Bag's thoughts on life and
      love. Of course it was both disturbing and funny but the greatest thing was
      that the writer referenced past events that should appeal to long time fans.
      Some minutes were also dedicated to covering the Self arc but it was only a
      minor one compared to the others. Last but not least beside the usual McGyver

      I thought maybe there would be a change, Lincoln gets captured by about 10 police
      cars,then it gets confirmed on the radio that he is in fact the most wanted
      person in the US or maybe the entire world because he was an escaped death row
      inmate. So, they decide that the best way to carry the most wanted man in the
      world is in a random police car. And of course, only 1 police car. I thought
      the show would have got more interesting after seeing the works of the FBI agent
      and seeing how he carefully picked off 1 inmate after another but instead I
      was completely repeled of the series showing how biased it is.One example, throughout
      the series they put main characters in tough positions, queue up the tense music
      trying to indicate that they will get caught. But nope, the main characters
