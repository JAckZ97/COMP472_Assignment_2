      but this is just a flaming garbage dump. Nobody gets hit by gun fire. Storyline
      is too predictable and bad. Gretchen is a terrible character. Really sad the
      path this show took. Prisoners in jail season to expert secret spies and thieves

    text: Heyo! It's Osama bin Laden. Only now he's called Abdul Ramal and he's locked
      up with Michael Scofield. Maybe Prison Break is taking it a step too far. I
      don't want to take this new season in the Prison Break series too seriously
      because then I might actually enjoy it more. But the thing is that beheadings
      and religious intolerance are not issues to be taken lightly. The second episode
      takes itself very serious with the introduction of these story lines. I'm curious
      to see where they take this series, but so far I'm not the least bit impressed.
      Show more Scofield and his Prison Break plan and show less of the dumber brother
      in the middle of simplified middle eastern conflicts.

    text: 'Season 5 The good: Michael, Linc and T-bag are by far the most watchable
      characters of this show. Scenes without them fell flat.The bad: All the other
      characters. Sarah has absolutely no charisma. The lead villain was uninteresting
      and unconvincing. I didn''t care about his fate at all. Ho hum. His assassins
      came over as hopeless amateurs.The Ugly: The Middle East / ISIS / Islamic setting
      was depressing and yet dull, and incompatible with the generic fun feel of the
      show. There was no suspense, no real sense of danger and no fun. The show cheated
      too much. The cells allowed prisoners to access overhead vents. The solitary
      cells were conveniently only locked by bolts. Etc. After that there were way
      too many plot loopholes and other implausible coincidences and miracles, such
      as bullets missing, people healing, and so on. So the entire escapade became
      meaningless. As mentioned, only there characters were fun to watch. The rest
      were uniformally awful. The first 3 episodes of the season were reasonably entertaining
      though. PB is weak once the characters are out of jail, and I was surprised
      that Season 5 script writers did not understand this. Season 1 was fantastic
      and Season 3 was fun. Season 2 was so and so and seasons 4 and especially 5
      were horrible.'

    text: 'The execution of Lincoln is delayed for two weeks because Judge Kessler
      anonymously receives new evidences about the case while Lincoln glances to his
      father in the observation room. Judge Kessler orders the exhumation of the remains
      of Terrance Steadman based on two different records about a removed appendix.
      Lincoln asks the name of the man in the room to Warden Pope and he tells that
      he is the journalist William Prall, from the Headline Press. Michael plots another
      escape plan through the asylum using the blueprint tattooed on his body. He
      borrows a guard''s uniform from Sucre''s cousin that works in the laundry to
      check his plan, but her burns his body on the steam piping; after a medical
      intervention, Michael finds that the part of the map with the escape route through
      the asylum is missing on his burnt back.This episode is only reasonable when
      compared with the previous ones. Steadman''s dental record was changed and the
      coroner goes nowhere with the exhumation. Michael will have unexpected problems
      with his new plan. The appearance of the missing father of Lincoln and Michael
      is the new mystery. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Adiamento" ("The Delay")'

      has been a genius from season 1. But the plan he came up to get rid of the one-eyed

    text: 'So, Prison Break ends. Sort of. More on that later. First, some very telling
      numbers. The first of which is 4.16 - the episode with original air date 22
      Dec 2008, and the first in a continuous string of episodes that I rated 2/10
      until this "final episode". However, after 4.16, the show went on a hiatus.
      Then, on 14 Jan 2009, Fox announced that the show would be ending. Which is
      just a PR-friendly euphemism for saying that the show has been canceled. And
      it was not until 17 April 2009 that the hiatus ended. What I''d really like
      to know, is what happened behind the scenes. The show had lost one third (3
      million) viewers compared to the height of its popularity during seasons 1 and
      2, so the suits'' decision to pull the plug is perfectly logical. The funny
      thing is, I can easily imagine the show-runners (producers and writers) saying
      one of General Krantz''s line in this episode: "Is this the end? Whimpering."
      And I would very much like to know what came into their mind next.The show-runners
      and the public were told there would be 6 episodes after the hiatus. So it was
      a bit like when ABC made the historical announcement that Lost would have "only"
      three seasons left after the third season, only on a smaller scale. Still, 6
      episodes is enough to exit either with a bang or a whimper. Sadly, we got the
      latter. Not that it would be apparent from the high IMDb ratings for the last
      six episodes - ranging from 7.6 to 8.8 for this very episode. But one has to
      remember, the voters come from the pool of those people who did *not* stop watching
      the show when it became both absurdly stupid and stupidly absurd. And the number
      of voters for the post-hiatus episodes averages a bit over 300 - not a reliable
      sample. The whimper would also not be apparent from the gushing reviews that
      have been voted most useful. But the usefulness of the reviews has been voted
      by about a dozen people - not a reliable sample either. Also, which one is more
      likely to write a gushing review: a person who did already waste 1 hour of their
      life watching this garbage or a person who is so enamored by the show that they
      have no objectivity? And which one is more likely to vote on the usefulness
      of a review, let alone read one? Back to the show-runners. It''s pretty apparent
      that they gave up, but at times during these six episodes, it almost felt like
      they were trying to joke about the absurdity of the show. *Almost.* Still, that
      thought did cross my mind when Mahone had a fit and yelled, "This is crap!"
      And when Lincoln pondered, "How stupid am I to end up framed *twice* for a high-level
      assassination?" But then, for this grand finale, they resurrected Kellerman,
      last seen shot full of holes at the end of season 2 because he had betrayed
      The Company. And they played the resurrection straight-faced. Are we to believe
      he was shot with rubber bullets? Or blanks? Or that that the hit-men missed?
      There is *no* frakkin'' way for a logic explanation for how that execution was
      not a real execution. The one Kellerman gives us is just ret-con BS. Then there
      is the unnecessary number of players at endgame. They serve no purpose other
      than to stretch things to fill the running time. Also, it is pathetic to write
      *three* questioning/torturing/leveraging segments that are interlaced. That''s
      one idea used three times at the same time! Again, no purpose other than to
      fill the running time. All this presumably to make sure there would be no time
      to explain what happened during the four years that are skipped before the final
      segment. Because - and this is the "sort of ends" part - people would have to
      *pay for* the straight-to-DVD "The Final Escape" to see what happened. So, nice-looking
      ending segment or not, this really is a whimper. 1/10.'

      end of the last episode I thought that they will continue with dramatic ending,what
      is why we all loved this show. But first time in 5 seasons they blow it up.
      The scene they break out is simply not made good .It has no drama in that scene.
      The story-line is revealing itself and it seems that there is nothing bigger
      in plot that is coming. There is no bigger plan behind the main story-line we
      are following. Hope there is something more to come.

      he gave up a bit too easily...anyway... still it had it's share of thrill rides

      the colossal mistakes that were seasons three and four, I was betrayed. Look,

      Terrorists was really comical and actually made me laugh. Laughing was good,
      because the tears helped lubricate my eyes, bringing them down from my skull
      after rolling them so much. The dialogue is exposition heavy, and so cheesy
      it should be served with a side order of macaroni.Yeah- Nah. It just, wasn't
      good. The idea itself is great, but there are huge gaps in the story (how was
      Sarah allowed back into the USA if she's a fugitive? T-Bag killed like a trillion
      people and escaped from THREE DIFFERENT PRISONS. How is he just being released
      after only serving seven years?).On a more positive note, I really like the
      new intro sequence. It fits in really well with the others, and helps season
      five really stand out versus the others.Whatever man. I'll be watching next
      week, I'm too far deep to quit now.

    text: 'It''s hard to believe Prison Break has (by this point, at least) sunk so
      low. This one reaches a new low: 2 out of 10 (I''ll reserve that "1 out of 10"
      for future, because I recently heard that an astoundingly stupid plot twist
      would be coming later on in the series). After the setup for season 3, the series
      has been plodding along, giving action scenes like the yard fights or the helicopter
      attack for viewers with ADD, who would be confused if the plot actually progressed,
      because by now The Company plot line has become so confusing and inconsistent
      that no one understands it. At the beginning of this episode, I was duped into
      believing that something would actually happen, with the introduction of the
      general who managed put crime kingpin Lechero behind bars. At first, the character
      acts like a man with such an achievement in his CV should: he successfully interrogates
      Michael, then Whistler, and goes to bring Gretchen in with a reasonable amount
      of soldiers. Then, even though he does not actually break Gretchen, he is smart
      enough to see that Gretchen has been trained to withstand torture. In the end,
      he brings Michael and Whistler in, leaving Gretchen only one option: to come
      clean or get a bullet. Then the writers realize they have painted themselves
      into a corner, so they just throw their arms into the air and come up with a
      completely incoherent resolution: Gretchen denies any knowledge of prison break
      attempts but reveals she knows where LJ is kept. So the Great General asks her
      to take him there. And he takes one soldier with them. ONE. But wait, there
      is more: Gretchen has managed to keep a hidden knife on her (apparently IN PANAMA
      they don''t know how to search for hidden weapons), with which she kills the
      soldier, then shoots the general. Now, how stupid is all this? I''ll predict
      the Panaman authorities won''t even put out an APB/Wanted for Gretchen, even
      when they know she was in the general''s presence when he was killed. And we''ll
      get to see Gretchen strut around without any worries of being arrested. The
      events lead to Michael and Whistler being put back inside the prison (Malone
      has been returned already) and we''re back to square one, nine episodes in the
      season. Thank the heavens for the WGA strike, which means there are only four
      more episodes of this rotten season left.'

      instead of Self or he got his other hand chopped off and had to spend the rest
      of his days in a disabled facility! Linc, Sucre, Sara and C-Note all got good

      audience during this abysmal season. This also explains the low number of users
      (around 375 per episode) who have rated each episode - others simply couldn't
      bother waste their time on this garbage that defiles the memory of the rather
      good first season. Thus, the ratings of the episodes are skewed because most
      of the people who rated the episodes were rabid fans with serious positive bias
      towards this show. Whereas I have no bias.This really was a good show during
      it's first season, and it's sad to see it sink this low. Everything is not only
      completely built on bull**** at this point, it is just unengaging and... boring.
      Episodes ago, Michael was diagnosed with a condition that needed IMMEDIATE surgery,
      yet he just keeps on trucking with the aid of injections, day after day, and
      when Sara tells him his dosage needs to be increased, Michael declines because
      of the side effects - apparently he can do just fine without ANY medication.
      You have to be an idiot to buy into this.Everything is just revolving around
      like a merry-go-around, some of the passengers just change. What's worse, the
      writers sideline their best character, Bagwell. Big mistake. The good thing
      is that Gretchen gets the spotlight and we get *actual* insight into her character.
      When has anything like that happened to any character in this show the last
      time? Also, she gets a bitching (tee-hee!) fight with Sucre which is the only
      high point in this predictable episode. Lots and lots of shooting guns here,
      yet no one hits no one. How bad are the highly trained agents and mercenaries?
      Yes, Prison Break is hardly the sole guilty party of this kind of unrealism,
      but at least in, for example, "24" people manage to hit their targets...So,
      the "big" surprise is that Michael gets caught by the Company. Whoopee! What
      a shocking turn of events. I am just unable to see where this is going next.
      No, wait, I'm not (and I haven't read the plots of the following episodes anywhere)
      - there's more bargaining and exchanges that always seem to go awry. Like I
      said, this is like a merry-go-around, they just keep changing the object (inanimate
      or animate) of the transaction. Why so I put up with this? Because maybe some
      potential future viewers/box set buyers will be convinced this show just ain't
      worth it anymore, hasn't been since season 2. I'll give this 4/10 - Gretchen's
      part would have made this a 5/10, but the recycled garbage deducts another point.
      Honestly, who was surprised about the bible-man twist? Or that Mahone gets double-crossed?
      And who finds Self's ruthlessness at the end just a bit a stretch too far? Or...
      etc. etc.

      Break. However the first minutes quickly managed to refresh my memories and
      the story was right back on track. The interesting part is that Michael and
      Lincoln are nearly working against each other and the Company are using these
      new antagonistic characters at their advantage. But for the General it's not
      as easy as before considering the new enemies he has. So all these elements
      make the story even more catchy but there're still many others that bother me.
      For example I found the episode rather long when it had the usual duration.
      It's a bad thing because it means it was a bit boring. Maybe it was the whole
      Michael and Sara plot because I don't believe anymore in their relationship.
      It's always about Michael and not about Sara when developing both characters
      would be far much more interesting. Moreover seeing Michael pulling out smart
      solutions, like a MacGyver, is not as appealing as it used to be. Otherwise
      Lincoln and his wacky team saved the episode, specially T-Bag and Alex. In fact
      I can't wait to see what William Fichtner will do once Prison Break is over
      because he's such a charismatic and talented actor !So to sum things up I'm
      sure fans are glad Prison Break is back. Because even if some things got old

      The original Prison Break's success was partly due to meticulous attention to
      detail and story line simmering, which was almost ignored in the new opener.
      Mike did not have to show up in the first episode, yet half way through it was
      obvious he was going to. There is a naivety and repetitiveness in Mike ending
      up in prison again, which the series must tackle carefully. Some parts of T-Bone's

      I have no idea where we left off, so let's all recap together, Sarah is in the
      wind. Sucre got away. C-Note has gone mad and gotten his wife, Kacee arrested.
      T-Bag has gone madder and is tracking down his would-be victim from the past.
      Bellick is in jail. Linc & Michael have been saved by Kellerman and Mahone has
      been shot. OK good.Tonight begins the reconstruction of the original plan that
      Michael had started. Kellerman is able to convince the brothers that he has
      flipped and is working against President Reynolds. There is no question about
      that when Kellerman kills two agents who were guarding Terrence Steadman. Now
      he and the duo of escapees shack up in a motel with Kellerman and wait it out.
      That becomes a bigger problem then we would think.Michael begins to stress about
      being so close to releasing the truth to the world and makes that ever so important
      decision to turn himself in to the news papers. But Steadman is able to snatch
      a gun and takes the selfish way out, all over the pretty painting. He is now
      just a John Doe and it is one of the final nails in the coffin for the escaped
      cons because Steadman being alive is of course the one thing that could prove
      Linc didn't kill him. Confused? Good! So good luck getting out of this one guys.
      Anyways a long way away we have T-Bag re-acquainting himself with Susan Hollander
      and her family. Lets hope family antics don't turn this show into a comedy because
      the fact that getting the $5 Million was the first thing on his list of to-do's
      before getting even with Susan seems a little odd to me. If you're a crazy who
      has a bizarre vendetta then why are plotting to steal bundles of cash first?
      But that's not the only storyline gone arouse. C-Note does not have a leg to
      stand on. He was able to get his wife and kid away from the police scramble
      that he put his homies through but now there is know where to go and the kid
      is asking why her mother was picked up by the cops. Nice hole you're in bud.Its
      nice to have the show back. I got hooked on 24 this season and now I'm in that
      mode where every episode should be an hour of the whole season. But that's OK
      because Prison Break does move quickly. One of my problems though, is that almost
      every commercial break has a cliffhanger that is more than likely a gun being
      pointed at someone. I think that we need a little more resolution so we can
      really care about the other situations going on. But they are still doing a
      good job.Read this review with all the links and others at www.MikeonTV.com

    text: I thought the episode was okay. A bit silly, but okay. The episode got to
      focus almost entirely on the action happening in the middle east. Without spending
      time on the Sarah plot, this episode was much more engaging and fast-paced.
      It was an exciting chase episode, shot on nice locations. With the group of
      characters on the run getting smaller, as a viewer you become more invested
      in them. Although the characters act pretty stupid and make poor decisions,
      due to the current quality of the current Prison Break, it didn't bother me
      much.The Poseidon stuff is still a little bit lame and corny though. And some
      of the dialogue feels really forced and corny. It probably has also to do with
      the fact that the two poseidon agents are being played by not-so-convincing
      actors.But overall I enjoyed myself for 40 minutes. But I won't deny that it
      all feels a bit sloppy and aimless.

    text: The most significant event in this episode is that Lincoln tells the world,
      as well as us, what "The Company" is. "They are a group of multinationals with
      corporate interests." "They are working with the highest levels of government,
      including the president of the United States." I believe Prison Break is one
      of the earlier shows that came up with this idea. Heroes's version of The Company
      developed in about 2007 and 2008. 24's version of a group of people who control
      the government and the President of the United States appeared in 2006 and 2007.
      Prison Break, on the other hand, had this idea from the beginning, and here,
      during the 15th episode of season 2, it finally gave "The Company" a formal
      definition, through the words of Lincoln and Michael.The characters continue
      to live in a very dark state, and the cast really look believable in their performances.
      Bill Kim never gets a break in his life, does he? It's like he has to respond
      to every event that ever happens in the world. Bellick just keeps getting into
      trouble and yet keeps finding ways to improve his situation. He's becoming a
      lite version of T-Bag, who just keeps surviving under horrible circumstances.
      How does Bellick even know all that about the Alcoholics Anonymous book anyway?
      Either he is an incredible reader who knows about a lot of books, or he has
      been in the AA program himself. Either way, it adds tremendous depth to his
      character. When you think about it, it makes sense that none of the federal
      agents in Mahone's office knows about this book. They are professionals who
      don't have drinking problems. When Bellick works with Mahone and provides his
      "street wisdom", that the academic people don't have, you see the strength of
      the low-lifes.Finally, Haywire is still alive. The writers decided to keep him
      going for a good part of the second season. There's a moment of foreshadowing
      in this episode. When Lincoln talks about Alex Mahone's history with the fugitives
      he has gone after before, we see Haywire on screen. Eventually Mahone will find
      Haywire, and history will probably repeat itself again. Before the inevitable
      downfall of Haywire, the writers gave him a moment to shine, to kill an abusive
      father and restores at least some amount of justice to this dark and desperate
      world.Kaley Cuoco's appearance in this episode was forgettable. She just doesn't
      fit in a show with such strong acting. Her character, like most characters on
      the show, has dark issues. But unlike other characters, she wasn't able to convey
      that in her performance. This was Kaley before The Big Bang Theory, her big
      break. Maybe she got better as an actress in that show. I don't know. Actors
      do get better sometimes. Wentworth Miller also couldn't act when he appeared
      on Ghost Whisperer and still couldn't act during season one of Prison Break.
      This year he got a lot better. I believe that working with so many talented
      actors, especially William Fichtner, has pushed him to develop his skills.

    text: 'After watching this one, I felt an urge to write a review. After noticing
      the two existing reviews, I felt it my *duty* to write a review. With all respect
      to the two reviewers before me, they give the impression that they are easily
      impressed and willing to hand out a full 10/10 even to a flawed work. Let me
      state this (and you know if you''ve read some of my other reviews): a 10/10
      *means* that the work *cannot* be improved upon (at the time of making when
      it comes to technological aspects of the production). Prison Break has never,
      ever delivered an episode that could not have been improved upon - some of the
      episodes when this was just a 13-episode miniseries (filling the gap left by
      "24") were 9/10s, but when they ditched the original plan and extended the series
      beyond its natural lifespan, the quality began to drop alarmingly.All sense
      was lost by season 3, and on season 4, I''ve rated every episode 4/10 because
      of the following reasons: 1) It''s all complete bull**** now, 2) It''s hard
      to care about the characters when everything is based on bull****, and 3) the
      tension just isn''t there anymore because by now you should have realized that
      the writers can come up with plot twists so idiotic, illogical and actually
      impossible that the next deus ex machina is always just waiting behind the corner
      (or in this case, a commercial break or the wait until the next episode).This
      episode, however, gets a 2/10. The stupidity hits an all-time low: having no
      original ideas, the writers rip off the Langley sequence from De Palma''s Mission
      Impossible, only adding thermometers to the security system. There''s even a
      fumble by Sucre, just like Tom Cruise had in the movie, for crying out loud!
      The two most stupid things here are: 1) Michael carrying out the break-in while
      in unstable health condition. Any sensible human being would realize that his
      condition seriously raises the risk of failure, and when he has a seizure (or
      whatever) on the bridge, you want to shoot the writers. 2) The General''s camera.
      Why the hell is it not *always* on? If there is a camera, any sensible user
      with access to it would always keep it on. It matters not whether Michael is
      aware of the alarm and the camera or not, since the decision to use the monitor
      rests on the general. Is the Big Bad of the Company really so stupid he doesn''t
      monitor the room? The writers sure seem to think they can make us buy such a
      ludicrous idea.The only thing preventing me from giving this a 1/10 is the fact
      that it *could* be worse. The production values could be lower, for instance,
      but as everyone who''s seen, let''s say, The Blair Witch Project, Clerks. or
      Paranormal Activity, knows that production values are just the icing on the
      cake. There have been way too many $100 to $250 million dollar movies that are
      complete bull**** because no-one bothered to write a proper script. Sadly, it
      seems that on the average, writers have not learned from their mistakes. But
      hey, who needs sense when you can make money without?'

      Their breathy brooding and how they keep giving opportunities to the bad guys

      1 Michael who is careful about most things takes a message board, which has
      been compromised, at face value. He leaves his get away and his brother to tie
      up a loose end.

      2 Michael stakes out a tropical holiday scene with a dark hoody pulled up around
      but not hiding his very publicized face.

      3 Mahone gets the better of Lincoln when he has him beat and a gun trained on
      him. Will this very camp manboy ever learn that saying "I swear to God, if you
      touch my brother" is not going to win him much?

      4 Most annoyingly, they keep giving T-Bag so much slack to F them (and anyone
      else) over. They put him in the back of the car and he gets the upper hand,
      yet again, plunging a screwdriver into a distracted and ever-emotional Sucre.

      5 Although they outnumber and outwit him and he has no authority, the crew follows
      the foolish (but funny) Bellick into a trap and let him be caught without finding
      out where he has had MariCruz locked up for a week. Really?

      I need to get some payback soon for my patience because, after about 40 episodes,

      term has changed back and forth around the time of writing), considering choosing
      one of my favorite movies. Then this episode came on and after having watched
      it I needed to vent my frustration.Some may wonder why I torture myself watching
      episodes which I find bad. The answer is simple: I have a principle of finishing
      what I started and I also refuse to surrender to an episode / a movie by switching
      channel / walking out.OK, this appears to be a fantastic episode because it''s
      taut, full of good twists, action, suspense and laughs. Also, most of the actors
      bring their A game for their roles, the winner being Jodi Lyn O''Keefe as Gretchen:
      her character seemed so bland and unimaginative in the third season, but given
      a chance to portray someone willing to resort to anything to stay alive, she
      truly *rules* (not coming up with a fancy term would do her performance justice).So
      what''s the problem? Prison Break had me from the first episode of season 1.
      The problem is the *fact* that the show was supposed to last only 13 episodes
      with a pre-planned ending, but when the initial ones proved a bigger success
      than anticipated, Fox decided to throw the ending away and expand Prison Break
      to a full season. And then renew it. And renew it. Kinda like The X Files -
      it was also a Fox show that was dragged on for longer that it had material to
      sustain the narrative (and that''s just the "mythology" episodes - some of the
      stand-alone ones were recycled). In the case of both series the decisions came
      to money: why kill a cash cow when you can underestimate your audience''s intelligence
      and throw all credibility out of the window?The problem is that this is no longer
      Prison Break. All the plot lines in the initial episodes were dropped because
      they had nowhere to go (remember, 13 episodes?) and replaced with a vague, sub-standard
      conspiracy plot line that was clearly made up as the show went on, with no pre-planned
      ending whatsoever. And now we are in the death rattle of the show. Seasons 2
      and 3 at least dealt with a prison break - here there is none. Why the hell
      is this show still called Prison Break?To go into the inconsistencies, illogicalities
      and contradictions of the show would take more time than I am willing to spend.
      Because of those things, there is no reason to care about the characters or
      where the plot is going. There is no reason to invest emotionally or intellectually
      in the show. This show should have stayed its planned course. The viewers disappeared
      during the fourth season, proving that Fox underestimated their intelligence.

      least talented screenwriters out there realize that this is much too camp! Michael
      Scofield''s monologue at the beginning, from which this is excerpted, marks
      as a fairly bad season opener already after 2 minutes. Sadly, nothing gets any
      better after that. The writers had some grand ideas again (caution: sarcasm),
      like killing two major roles of season 3 in the first 15 minutes or all convicts
      somehow escaping Sona because this "high security prison" just burns down. Furthermore,
      the return of Sara is made very bad, which makes it really difficult for me
      to like the fact that she''s back again. But I''m not done yet: what''s up with
      all the escaped convicts thinking that they can just go around like normal people,
      while in season 2 they had fake IDs and hiding places and stuff? Of course,
      each of them gets caught in the first half an hour and of course Michael''s
      highest amount of jail time is 15 years, I''m sure this is a proper amount of
      time after escaping two penitentiaries and killing someone. I can''t exactly
      say where this episode ends and #2 starts because it''s a double episode, but

    text: I've reviewed quite a few season 4 episodes of Prison Break, yet the show's
      astonishing stupidity compels me to write a new one something like every other
      week. Because it really is coming dangerously close to being the Batman & Robin
      equivalent of TV strictly in terms of quality and entertainment value (the latter
      being a matter of opinion, of course). Again, no wonder the show died in USA
      and here in Finland they waited a whole year after the end of season 3 to dump
      this load on us.It's now pointless to kick this show about its plot holes since
      it seems to consist only of plot holes. And the "plotting" seems to follow the
      6-year old child's play logic of "and then they could..." - except that the
      6-year old could probably come up with a more coherent plot. The characters,
      meanwhile, are reduced to two-dimensional cardboard (remember, "one-dimensional"
      is only a straight line) with no consistent motivation and the only purpose
      of existence the needs of the writers to put boring exposition into their mouths
      and serve us "twists" according to the writers' whims.Since there were three
      pre-existing reviews more favorable than mine, I thought it only fair to see
      how they justified their ratings. One showed sarcasm and stated that "Fortunately
      this series is coming to an end" yet gave the episode 7/10. A bit high, since
      a 7 means that something is above the average of 5.5 - and this certainly isn't.
      Another reviewer had some trouble with the English language but I gathered that
      the amount of twists and cliffhangers made this worth a 9. Unfortunately their
      gushing review and declaration of love for the show reveal that they have lost
      all objectivity when reviewing this series. Again, it is important to note that
      the first third or so of season 1 was genuinely fantastic, but turning a blind
      eye to the show's later faults is not something I can do. The third reviewer
      noted that the brothers' relationship was "further developed". In what sense,
      I wonder? The only new thing was the "twist" in their relationship and that
      came straight from the bottom of the barrel. I also wonder why they thought
      that the Scylla arc was "very interesting" and couldn't help but laugh when
      they noted that the writing was "nearly fascinating". *Nearly*? And they gave
      10/10! I wonder what they would have given had the writing been "thoroughly
      fascinating" - 11/10 perhaps? Really, it seems that outside of the Twilight
      fan-base, this series had the most deluded fan-base in the world. Interesting
      though that there were no American reviews. Again, my vote is 2/10.

      stupidity break me like most of the people I know who used to watch the show
      but gave up. Now Michael and Lincoln's mother is suddenly alive (her having
      been dead from the start of the series was a lie, you see) and has a plan for
      Scylla. Why am I not surprised? This makes just about as much sense as anything
      else since season 2. Clandestine warfare inside the company? Please. It's about
      as clandestine as 9/11. Since the actual purpose of Scylla isn't all that exciting
      (WHY?), the writers really are throwing everything at the wall, hoping that
      something would stick. Everything keeps changing for no plausible reason and
      results in more pointless running in circles.Actually, there was potential for
      interesting character exploration in Gretchen, but, not recognizing a chance
      when they accidentally create one, the writers stupidly (seemly) kill her off.
      Since she isn't even allowed a death scene nor a capture scene, I can only prophecize
      that she will be seen again, as a "surprise twist". Probably another one which
      will not make sense. She deserved better. Also, since Amaury Nolasco is credited
      in the opening titles as a series regular, we'll probably see him too later
      on. The writers just didn't have any use for his character after this dumb A-Team
      rip-off (more like F-team) began.At this point, the series is so bad, it does
      not even get me infuriated like earlier, when it seemed that the pieces might
      actually make some sense when put together. But since the writers have been
      making pieces up for the past three years, no way in hell will this make any
      sense when watched from beginning of season 1 to the end. Which is really a
      shame because had this remained the 13-episode miniseries as originally planned,
      it would have been *gold*. The first third of season 1 is *really* good. This
      final season is a disgrace to the name and intent of the series original plan.
      What prison? What break? And if someone tries to argue that the "prison break"
      is used as a metaphor at this point, they are seriously deluded. This will end
      in the same kind of senseless embarrassment as "The X Files" (and that was gold
      too for maybe the first three seasons). My vote is 2/10.

    text: The original 4-series was an astounding achievement! But this season 5 is
      so much worst. The directing & camera angle is more intense but the storyline
      is just plain stupid and not worthy to be a successor. It's only 10 episodes.
      The ultimate goal of the entire season is not intriguing, the antagonist has
      bad acting, and does not involve a grand scale conspiracy like the original
      4 seasons.If you want to proceed to Season 6, make sure the story writer create
      a spectacular grand conspiracy involving nation leaders around the globe. Otherwise,
      say GOODBYE to Prison Break series.

    text: Man, this is not a good episode. It seemed like everyone is tired, Dominic
      Purcell is phoning it in here pretty bad. It has no life at all this episode,
      and really slowed the season down so far. Episode 4 was great, but last two
      are similar episode 3, which was bad as well. This show is very inconsistent
      at the moment. The characters this episode were stupid, dumb and nothing like
      themselves, all seem tired. The new Company type agents were over exposed here,
      were very disappointing and are downright comical. Cyclops was a joke as well
      throughout, comical again. I'm not sure why no T-bag or Sarah here, they were
      desperately needed. Whip is the all star of the show, he is the only one trying
      at the moment. Can't wait till season is over, let it rest.

    text: Well that was fast. They're already out of prison. Okay. Lacks build-up
      or cleverness but okay. I did actually enjoy this episode. For the first time
      during it's new run I was engaged in what happened. It was fast-paced, well
      edited and the story gave us a couple of twist I did not expect to happen (so
      soon in the season). I'm a bit worried that they will go all out with the conspiracy
      crap (Poseidon) and I really hope it doesn't become a fast repeat of that A-team
      bullshit from the fourth season. Because we're already out of the prison, the
      show has lost it's most interesting concept pretty fast without using it to
      their advantage for an engaging story. Overall a decent thrilling episode and
      the best of the new batch so far.

      should have ended after season 1. But it made loads of money so like many series
      that should have ended they kept on with it, and it gets lost up its own backside.

    text: Well, I am shocked. What an anti-climax.I have never seen such forced writing,
      action or plot elements to end a story than in this debacle of an ending.For
      a show that in the first season had you seriously concerned and tense for the
      characters and their predicament, it never seemed likely the bad guys would
      win. Some old characters would resurface from nowhere like a deus ex machina
      to save the day. Lincoln survives for god knows how long after being shot.Sarah,
      who moans about Michael pointing guns at people ends up shooting someone.Schofield
      and Sarahs relationship is so sterile i doubt they could ever of had sex - I
      have never even seen them kiss. They just hug and look worried on each others
      shoulders. Ridiculous.I personally started disliking prison break after series
      2 - season four has been a complete waste of time. If they were going to do
      it, they should of done it correctly. Its bad storytelling, bad writing, bad
      acting, the reduction of good characters to ones that haven't developed at all
      from the second series.Poor. So so poor. Its a shame. Move on to The Wire people,
      much more of a complete show.

    text: So, the second episode in the season of stupidities. First stupidity when
      Veronica walks inside Terence Stead man's house saying hello to him, without
      any weapon, without any protection, thinking she will be allowed to stroll in
      there and call the cops after a cozy chat and thus gets herself killed. Episode
      1. In episode 2, Lincoln and Michael decide to rescue LJ from the courthouse,
      except just near the courthouse Lincoln decides to stand openly on the streets
      outside a shop from which Mike is buying supplies, without a hat, without his
      goggles, without any kind of disguise and wink and nod at passing ladies. I
      mean, seriously? Is that what two guys, whose photos have been plastered all
      over newspapers and walls and one of whom is on death row for murdering the
      President's brother for God's sake, about to run off with a lad from the courthouse
      do? Which world of stupidity do they come from? Which person about to break
      into a courthouse and steal a criminal nods and smiles at passersby, especially
      when he himself is on the most wanted list? Height of nonsense.

    text: I really don't care that you kill main characters, in fact, I love it because
      instead of knowing what's going to happen. The show keeps you tensed up. On
      the other hand when it comes to the Burrows brothers. It does quite the opposite.
      I thought maybe there would be a change, Lincoln gets captured by about 10 police
      cars,then it gets confirmed on the radio that he is in fact the most wanted
      person in the US or maybe the entire world because he was an escaped death row
      inmate. So, they decide that the best way to carry the most wanted man in the
      world is in a random police car. And of course, only 1 police car. I thought
      the show would have got more interesting after seeing the works of the FBI agent
      and seeing how he carefully picked off 1 inmate after another but instead I
      was completely repeled of the series showing how biased it is.One example, throughout
      the series they put main characters in tough positions, queue up the tense music
      trying to indicate that they will get caught. But nope, the main characters
      have teleported away somehow knowing the danger is coming. Like come on, if
      you're going to overuse that, no one falls for it after doing it once but since
      almost every TV show and film does it, it's so pointless and predictable.

      injuries by falling on that car... anything else...i am starting to hate that
      FBI agent Mahone...and i really wanna know how they will escape now(the brothers).
      One of the best thing that happens in this episode is that t-bag is beginning
      to be very smart :D ....And please don't kill Sucre in episode 2x13. And i have
      some question.... 1.Is the cop going to be sent at Fox River? 2.Will Mahone

    text: Lazily plotted and corny ham-fisted set-up episode which, despite these
      aspects still leaves you wanting to watch the rest of the series. As a former
      Prison Break watcher, who loved the first season, liked the second season, enjoyed
      the third season and hated most of the fourth season, I went in expecting lazily
      plotted overused story lines and poorly written on the nose expositionary dialogue.
      It was exactly what I got. ISIL??... Really?I had a hard time getting through
      the predictable first 30 minutes which establishes that Sarah Wayne Callies
      is just as annoying and boring as she has always been as Sarah Tancredi (except
      maybe in the first season). These first 30 minutes also make you remember how
      bad the fourth season was, because they pull the same conspiracy bullsh*t here.
      The last five minutes gave me hope that they will give more of the vibes from
      the first season and (poor but still enjoyable) third season.When you go into
      this revival series not giving a damn, you will actually like more than you'd
      expected in the first place. Let's see where this goes.
