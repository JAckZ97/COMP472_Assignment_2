No.1 -- Spoilers**Brought prison break intensity back. This episode has everything. Best episode so far. From brothers reunion to villain behind all of this. There was a clear and believable explanation for Michael fake death. There were many scenes where you will experience adrenaline rush. SO SO WAITING FOR THE NEXT

No.2 -- Most Prison Break Episodes are gripping and have clever decisions involved. This one is perhaps one of the best episodes in terms of anticipation and the kind of masterminding Michael does.The subtle underplay of dialogs where the General says, "Frustration must be killing you" and then Michael also returns the "Frustration must be killing you" ! "Leverage" on the phone call... and "they'll all see you coming." and then the "See you at the Rendezvous" comes in even in this season.An amazing amazing episode! Totally blown by the execution.Of course every episode of Prison Break tells you that the boys had one victory but are going to face another challenge and that is what happens towards the end of this episode as well, and you get the drift when you actually see that everything seems to easy, and you know something is going to give.Also, Self had started to act a lil shaken, and if you consider that he was going to drive around the city so carelessly, you get the hint something is cooking.

No.3 -- With the unexpected fail of Michael's plan, the five frustrated inmates return to the storage room. Michael begs Sara to talk with Veronica and Nick first to see the evidences and to ask for clemency to her father. Meanwhile Nick and Veronica appeal in court of Judge Kessler and request an exhumation of Steadman remains. Michael learns that if something goes wrong with the electric chair, the execution is delayed. He uses a rat to short-circuit the electric installation, but David overhears the conversation and rats Michael's talk to Captain Bellick. Sara stays with Lincoln in his cell; later Michael and Veronica have a last meeting with him and he talks with his son LJ by phone. When Lincoln is walking to the electric chair, the governor calls to say that he had reviewed the process and denied the request of clemency."The Rat" is certainly the most dramatic episode of "Prison Break" up to this moment. Dr. Tancredi is really involved with Michael and Lincoln and the claws of the Vice-President Caroline Reynolds are extending, using her power and influence to execute Lincoln. Fox River is full of rats, the long-tailed rodents and the inmate David. The impressive performance of Wade Williams is again awesome. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "O Rato" ("The Rat")

No.4 -- My honest opinion is that they should've made this season a bit longer so it would be more enjoyable, it just feels so rushed at times,I don't mean 20+ episodes, that would have been way too stretched. I think 13 to 15 episodes is enough.The writing in season 5 is still good(with a bit of flaws but every show has it so its alright), directing and acting is also good as usual.but after nearly a decade of the show being "over" you would expect those 9 episodes to be perfected to the last second. I'm gonna binge watch it soon to see if I missed somethingI would love to see more of their back stories, from each character, more scenes about prison tension, getting to know the characters, more talking about their past, more mysteries and stuff like that. when Whip got shot I mean it wasn't believable or anything, it was weird and silly, I was like .. ...what the hell ... .. .. [20 seconds later] should I feel sorry for him?? or T-Bag for losing his son after only knowing him for 2 days, or what??? should I be "oh man why he died... such a shame..." I gotta admit it was kinda laughable, that whole situation..., T-bag coming out unarmed like "oh no, stop, don't shoot", .he was a decent guy but had no time to get interested in him. although Sid's death was tragic, he was a young dude on the run, about to flee the country, live free and then he got killedthat is I guess the only main issue I have with this final season, it feels so rushed but we still have like one or two filler episodes when they were on the run from prison, episode 5 had nice ending, the prison break style i loved it but that entire episode could've been put into 10 minutes or less loll(if you re-watch it you will see)if this season were 15 episodes long it would'be been more than great, I love that most of the cast got back together to shoot this final season and I appreciate them giving us more Prison Break material.

No.5 -- This was one of the best Prison Break episodes for a while, probably the best so far in Season 3. It was fast moving, exciting, and ended with a classic Prison Break cliff-hanger at the end. With lots of action and events all packed into one episode, it did not disappoint. From a critical perspective, there were some slightly strange, rather intangible moments, but it does remain to be a show which appeals to its viewers by being believable, unlike shows like Lost and Heroes.This season has finally kicked into action and everyone will be disappointed after the next episode when there will be another long period of time before the next offering of the great TV series!

No.6 -- Lincoln tries to find a clue in Whistler's bird guide in his hotel room; when he sees an envelope with pictures of LJ and Sara underneath his door; he tries to find the carrier but meets Sucre instead. Lincoln visits Michael on the next morning and shows the picture of Sara, where she seems to be pointing to some hint of her location. Michael requests a phone to call Sara. Sofia Lugo visits her boyfriend Whistler and finds the address of Lincoln in the visitors list. Mahone is wandering in Sona needy of Viratril; when the public defender Raul visits him and tells that his trial is scheduled on the next year; Mahone demands the medication and Raul refuses to get it. Michael blackmails T-Bag, threatening to disclose that he is a rapist and pedophile to Lechero; T-Bag gets the cell phone and later he distracts the crime lord permitting Michael to return it to the charger. Lechero discuss with his partner Augusto that somebody is stealing his business; later T-Bag intrigues Lechero against Sammy. Sofia meets Lincoln and he tells that they are in the same side. He finds the hideout in the red light district where Sara and LJ are hidden, but he arrives late in the place. Whistler, who claims to be a fisherman, talks to Mahone seeking information about Michael.In this third episode, Lincoln finds his son and Sara, but he does not succeed in rescuing them. Michael is plotting a means to escape from Sona, and apparently he noted that dead bodies are taken to the outside. The tricky T-Bag is falling under the grace of Lechero, and he seems that will get rid off Sammy. The secret about Whistler and the interest of the Company on him is intriguing. What is the content of the box left in the garage by Susan? My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "O Telefonema" ("The Phone Call")

No.7 -- Season 5 The good: Michael, Linc and T-bag are by far the most watchable characters of this show. Scenes without them fell flat.The bad: All the other characters. Sarah has absolutely no charisma. The lead villain was uninteresting and unconvincing. I didn't care about his fate at all. Ho hum. His assassins came over as hopeless amateurs.The Ugly: The Middle East / ISIS / Islamic setting was depressing and yet dull, and incompatible with the generic fun feel of the show. There was no suspense, no real sense of danger and no fun. The show cheated too much. The cells allowed prisoners to access overhead vents. The solitary cells were conveniently only locked by bolts. Etc. After that there were way too many plot loopholes and other implausible coincidences and miracles, such as bullets missing, people healing, and so on. So the entire escapade became meaningless. As mentioned, only there characters were fun to watch. The rest were uniformally awful. The first 3 episodes of the season were reasonably entertaining though. PB is weak once the characters are out of jail, and I was surprised that Season 5 script writers did not understand this. Season 1 was fantastic and Season 3 was fun. Season 2 was so and so and seasons 4 and especially 5 were horrible.

No.8 -- More on the nose dialogue!! "You know that American is Michael, right?" Really C-Note? Lincoln is dumb, but if he didn't figure that out by himself maybe someone else should help Michael escape.. Oh wait... Sorry! He told him so the audience wouldn't be confused..This show really doesn't expect it's audience to be too smart. You can explain things by suggestions or visual imagery, other than have your character flat out tell the audience the information. And if that same information was already painfully clear by the events preceding the scene, you definitely don't have much faith in the attention span of your audience. Come on, Scheuring! Have a little faith in your audience.The episode is still an improvement over the previous episode. But it's a shame that the new series wants to focus on more conspiracies again. It's an element that killed the previous season. The prison stuff could be way more interesting if they would focus more on the life inside such a prison (like they did with Fox River or even Sona). But most of the time they try to develop a conspiracy outside of the prison with Sarah in the middle.Spoiler: We get an emotional last couple of minutes, when Michael's escape fails. But as a viewer I was glad. Maybe now as a viewer we can get invested in an escape plan which we see Michael develop. Because constantly having Wentworth Miller say; we're going to escape tonight" and You have to trust me" is not a good way to build your tension and excitement. Because you don't even know what they want to do. Which results in you not being very invested in what's going on. (With Fox River and Sona, you were on the edge of your seat because you saw a plan develop and it felt like you were escaping with them.) And if Michael's character is too smart for audiences to follow, please develop a character inside the prison next to Michael. (as an ally, not as a potential distrustful backstabber) The show needs a new focal point (like Fernando Sucre) with whom the audience can identify more. Because it sure as hell isn't Michael.Let's see what Michael will pull out of his ass in the next couple of episodes.

No.9 -- So there was an ending there. I saw it... But it lasted for like 10 seconds. Just to make things clear i' m okay i guess with making an introduction to a new plot BUT not in that way and not in the last episode of the season people.So here are my compaints. Fistly it needs to be said that its remarkable the way that they make us not enjoy something we' ve been waiting for so long... little Asian guy hello like gets killed and I' ve reached a point where i'm ready to go and save him myself. (Same goes for Paul who I hated with my whole existence during 1st season).Now on to the real stuff. So, just as things are finally falling into place after 44 (22+22) episodes of literal hell and just as i' m about to have 5 minutes of joy with michael and sarah finally heading into the sunset, dolphins jumping from the waves and Celine singing my heart will go on, someone' s coming screaming to our ears "not that easy B*t&%" and reminds us, with no tact I must add, that there' s going to be a 3rd season in case you dared to think differently and most importantly that you are going to watch it either you want or not. Yeah...so that was violent and I' m against violence generally. Only peace you guys.

No.10 -- In Tooele, Michael locates the place where the foundation of the silo might be under the garage of a house. They lure the owner, Jeanette, interrupting the energy of their house and telling that they work for the power company and they need to work in her garage. Tweener has troubles in the hardware store when he stumbles with a friend of the owner. Meanwhile Mahone arrives in the Salt Lake City Field Office and investigates where DB might have hidden the money. Governor Tancredi sees Kellerman in Washington and calls Sara.

When a policewoman arrives at Jeanette's house, tension increases among the escapees.In this episode, Governor Tancredi discovers who Lance is and now Sara is aware about her new acquaintance. But the most important part is the capture of Tweener by the obsessed Mahone, who seems to be a psychopath. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Subdivisão" ("Subdivision")

Habe found a guy to help them with the record and he was being extremely cooperative just because he was a friend of their father's because he wasn't copper but they got rid of the fake copper. Bagwell murdered a therapist that looked like him and started acting like him. Franklin became useless because they found Michael so Kim asked mahone to kill him so mahone sent to his cell rope to make him kill himself just like he forced the schizophrenic guy to jump off the silo. The tape turned out to be useless because of the time stamp but they'll blackmail the president but at the same time Kellerman was about to assassinate her.

No.12 -- contains spoilers I'm quite disappointed with this episode. After interesting end of the last episode I thought that they will continue with dramatic ending,what is why we all loved this show. But first time in 5 seasons they blow it up. The scene they break out is simply not made good .It has no drama in that scene. The story-line is revealing itself and it seems that there is nothing bigger in plot that is coming. There is no bigger plan behind the main story-line we are following. Hope there is something more to come.

No.13 -- Oh...My...God. Thats all i have to say for this episode, Sucre betrays his gang, and the truth about Oscar Shales is finally revealed. Mahone is a killer and he killed TWEENER! I was still in shock and i give this episode the best possible rating because of how it took us on a whole different road. We thought Tweener would tell on the out-mates ( =P ) but instead he goes to his girlfriend and tells her his last words (not knowing- of course- that they were his last words) Agent Mahone later takes Tweener to a far-away place and shoots him after telling him he shot Oscar Shales. Then he put the gun in Tweeners hand to make it look as if Tweener killed himself. LJ Burrows is on release from prison in Arizona, and Governor Tancredi has been hanged. When the president's sidekick tells Paul that Sarah needs to die too, Paul gets a look on his face so it appears as though Agent Paul Kellermen has feelings for Sarah. Back in the house where the out mates are digging, the money is found and Lincoln went to take LJ and they will meet Michael in Mexico. All the men take the money out of the whole, but Sucre appears with a gun telling everybody to put the money down. That is the end of the 7th episode.

No.14 -- Papa is dead and Sammy presses Lechero to kill Michael; Lechero replies that he also wants Michael dead, but he does not want an uprising in Sona. Mahone receives a mail with a picture of his son. Lechero, Michael, Mahone, Whistler and T-Bag inspect the hole in the tunnel and Michael requests a saw and hammer to support the tunnel. Sammy takes the power of Sona with the pistol delivered by Augusto and other three gangsters and promises a box of bottles of rum for the inmate that kills Michael. T-Bag convinces Bellick to give the chicken foot to Sammy promising him to join the escape team; when he discovers that there is no acetone, he unsuccessfully tries to call-off the fight. Meanwhile Lincoln and Sofia visits Osberto and buys a bomb; Sucre plants the bomb under the seat of Gretchen's car but she unravels that she found Maricruz tracking the US$ 25,000.00 check she gave to him. Sammy leaves the fighting with Bellick to chase Michael, who is locked behind the door in the tunnel with Mahone. Sammy beats Whistler, who was left behind, trying to get the combination of the door. Michael removes a wedge from the hole and the tunnel collapses over Sammy, burying him, while Lechero and Mahone kill the three other gangsters. Sofia finds a wallet hidden in Whistler's bag.The greatest question in "Dirt Nap" is who Whistler is. The quintet and maybe Bellick are "back in business" after the death of Sammy, and Lechero is stronger in Sona. The ambiguous Mahone is uplifted after receiving the picture of his son (I believe that it was sent by Agent Lang). Sucre is really a stupid guy, sending the check to Maricruz instead of the untraceable money. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Por um Fio" ("In the Edge")

No.15 -- So, Michael finds his way to Phaecia on foot through the dessert and then boards a boat that takes them all to Crete in 12 hours!! With no passports no less. At the same time Sarah lands on an airport in Crete. How do we now it's Crete? Well, because of the Greek word written on a window. Which, by the way, is just some Greek letters put together and doesn't mean anything. Then, Michael gets a blood transfusion in a hotel room. Sarah has even brought syringes and saline solution with her. I guess the 100ml rule doesn't apply for her. And, later, when Michael wakes up and tells her that her husband is indeed Poseidon, she just says that she knew it but she asked him if he was a killer and he said no. Oh ok then. Why shouldn't she believe him, right? So, after she realises her husband is actually a killer, and she has left her kid with him, what does she and Michael do? Well, what any normal parent would do: sit around, talk about Michael's misfortunes and then "oh God! Mike. I've left him with Jacob." As if she had forgotten to turn off the oven.
I bet it didn't take the screenwriter more that half an hour ro write this script. Maybe the whole of season 6 for that matter.

No.17 -- Lincoln unsuccessfully beats up on Wyatt trying to force him to call General Krantz and tell that he killed the brothers. Then Self arrives with a wallet and tells that he needs a nice conversation with Wyatt, and Sara goes to the cell under the surveillance of Mahone. Lisa tells Krantz that she needs three days to move Scylla, and he orders to distribute the pictures of Michael and his group to the press. Michael, Lincoln, Bellick and Sucre go to T-Bag office in Gate and they reach the pipe conducting the water supply of LA and conclude that it is impossible to dig the concrete beneath. Self tells Mahone that he sympathizes with him and he also lost his wife and baby. White is worried with the vanishing of Andy Blauner, and T-Bag is interrogated by a detective that is investigate the disappearance. Self lures Wyatt and leaves him alone with Mahone that wants him to call Pam feeling fear in his voice. Gretchen arrives with a pistol in General Krantz's office; he calls her "my girl", kisses her and recalls when she failed in the Police Academy because of her psychological test that accused that she is emotionally disconnected and sociopath. Mahone tortures Wyatt that calls Pam and the killer tells that he is sorry. T-Bag changes Andy's sale records and convinces White that he has embezzled Gate. Bellick has a surprising attitude in the water duct.There are great surprises in this show: the expected duel between Mahone and Wyatt; the unexpected attitude of Bellick; and the intriguing meeting of Gretchen with General Krantz. What is her real intention is the mystery to be solved in the next episodes. The health problem with Michael may be a problem in the future. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available

No.19 -- It's hard to believe Prison Break has (by this point, at least) sunk so low. This one reaches a new low: 2 out of 10 (I'll reserve that "1 out of 10" for future, because I recently heard that an astoundingly stupid plot twist would be coming later on in the series). After the setup for season 3, the series has been plodding along, giving action scenes like the yard fights or the helicopter attack for viewers with ADD, who would be confused if the plot actually progressed, because by now The Company plot line has become so confusing and inconsistent that no one understands it. At the beginning of this episode, I was duped into believing that something would actually happen, with the introduction of the general who managed put crime kingpin Lechero behind bars. At first, the character acts like a man with such an achievement in his CV should: he successfully interrogates Michael, then Whistler, and goes to bring Gretchen in with a reasonable amount of soldiers. Then, even though he does not actually break Gretchen, he is smart enough to see that Gretchen has been trained to withstand torture. In the end, he brings Michael and Whistler in, leaving Gretchen only one option: to come clean or get a bullet. Then the writers realize they have painted themselves into a corner, so they just throw their arms into the air and come up with a completely incoherent resolution: Gretchen denies any knowledge of prison break attempts but reveals she knows where LJ is kept. So the Great General asks her to take him there. And he takes one soldier with them. ONE. But wait, there is more: Gretchen has managed to keep a hidden knife on her (apparently IN PANAMA they don't know how to search for hidden weapons), with which she kills the soldier, then shoots the general. Now, how stupid is all this? I'll predict the Panaman authorities won't even put out an APB/Wanted for Gretchen, even when they know she was in the general's presence when he was killed. And we'll get to see Gretchen strut around without any worries of being arrested. The events lead to Michael and Whistler being put back inside the prison (Malone has been returned already) and we're back to square one, nine episodes in the season. Thank the heavens for the WGA strike, which means there are only four more episodes of this rotten season left.

No.25 -- You ended the last episode with kellerman acting as if he will save them. Prison break then goes to a interval with the audience thinking if he is trustable. This episode gets more and more closer, but then gives the viewers more entertainment and adventure to look forward to. If you are a prison break fan like me, honestly you don't want it to end so soon, a few more episodes. This episode focuses on 4 main stories, The first is the actual Micheal, Kellerman and Lincoln. This keeps you hooked on with some great action and adventure. The Second is the Jailer and his day in prison, being forced to be a b i t c h, which is so entertaining to watch. The third is T Bag and the family, makes you wonder if he will do something nasty, hope not. The fourth is C Note and his dilemma. Anyway this episode was enjoyable. As usual another great episode.

No.26 -- Michael tries to get a bolt in a bleacher but the seat belongs to the dangerous racist Theodore 'T-Bag' Bagwell that takes the bolt from him. Meanwhile Michael needs the drug Pugnac to fake diabetes to continue going to the infirmary as part of his escaping plan. However, his Afro-American contact sees him trying to retrieve the bolt with T-Bag and denies the drug to Michael. Michael also tries to convince Veronica Donovan that Lincoln is innocent, but when she sees a security tape delivered by the prosecutor showing Lincoln with a gun in the parking area, she questions his innocence.In this second episode, Michael follows his plan but he has frictions with dangerous inmates and also with Captain Bradley 'Brad' Bellick.

No.27 -- As the news has just broken out that Prison Break will be returning to us in 2016, I thought I'd re-watch the series and write a review for each episode. MAJOR SPOILERS!!I heart Prison Break :)S1 Ep 1 -Best Quote : "Better than that. I've got 'em on me." Michael Schofield.Best Moment(s) : The tattoo reveal.Worst Moment(s) : Michael being beaten up in the yard with what looked like rocks in a sack. Quite tame compared to what's coming though.Yum : Michael smirking when he hears the police sirens outside the bank and of course, topless Michael.Bro Love : Michael helping Sucre with his proposal letter. Michael vowing to get Lincoln out of prison.Story : Michael is sentenced to five years in Fox River Penitentiary after shooting a gun in a bank during an attempted robbery – the same Penitentiary that his brother, Lincoln Burrows has been sent to. Coincidence? I think not. As far as Michael is concerned Lincoln is innocent, but how innocent is he?Bunking with Fernando Sucre, Michael is brought up to speed on how the prison works – everyone has their place and getting practically anything imported into the prison is possible. Michael sets about his breakout plan, using the yard and Dr. Tancredi's office for a start... but he doesn't get too far before the prison Warden wants to see him. Not because he's on to him, oh no. The Warden wants Michael to help him finish building the Taj Mahal sculpture for him and his wife's anniversary, as he knows that Michael is a structural engineer by trade. Michael turns him down – If he's in the Warden's office three days a week, how will he have time to break Lincoln out? Michael tells Veronica Donovan, his lawyer, a childhood friend and Lincoln's ex-girlfriend, that Lincoln is being framed, and that she needs to focus on finding out who by instead of spending time trying to get Michael out of Fox River.Meanwhile - two agents from the Secret Service are trying to make sure that nothing will get in the way of Lincoln suffering the death sentence for the crime he's supposedly committed – killing the Vice President's brother. They visit a Bishop who has the power to stop the execution as the case is being appealed for Lincoln's innocence. They tell him he must go ahead with the death sentence regardless, but the Bishop refuses. He has beliefs to follow.Back in Fox River, John Abruzzi finds out that Michael knows the identity of the man who snitched on him and landed him in prison the same Abruzzi who happens to be in charge of 'P.I' (Prison industry work). After confronting Michael, wanting him to reveal the whereabouts of the snitch, Fibonacci, they get in to a fight. This fight leads to The Warden threatening to put Michael in 'The Shoe' for ninety days – which would go past Lincoln's execution date – so Michael agrees to build the Taj Mahal sculpture for The Warden instead. When Veronica hears about The Bishop being killed, she knows what Michael told her was correct : Someone wants Lincoln dead, but who? And why? L.J believes his father is guilty and after getting arrested for selling drugs and being forced by his mother to visit Lincoln in prison for some 'fatherly advice', L.J washes his hands of him.As the infirmary is essential to Michel's escape plan, he needs to make sure he has a reason to be there. He reacts badly to the insulin shots Dr Tancredi has given him because, shocker, he's lied to her about having diabetes. Speaking to Benjamin Franklyn, the prison pharmacist, he pays for a medicine that can counter the insulin shots so it looks like he does have diabetes. Abruzzi adds Michael to the boys in P.I, keeping his friends close but his enemies closer, and Michael finally reveals his tattoo to Lincoln. He has the blueprints of the Fox River on his body, and he has a plan to break Lincoln out.Fatalities/Deaths : 1 – Prison inmate, stabbed in the neck by fellow inmate. 2 – The Bishop, shot in the head by Secret Service.Questions/Observations : First time we see Michael's special Origami. Did he really think throwing the hard drive in to the sea would ensure that his plans were gone forever? Sucre doesn't know how to spell 'passion'. It's obviously not L.J's first time being involved in dodgy drug deals. Michael using Sara's senior quote to bond with her on their first meeting is kind of not okay and makes you wonder, if he hadn't known all those things prior to meeting her, would they have had the same spark? The same connection? He had done a LOT of research so who knows. How strange do both Michael and Lincoln look with hair?! I'm so used to seeing them near enough bald. D.B Cooper denies he's D.B Cooper. It's interesting to see that Abruzzi was always going to be involved in the escape, as Michael knows he can provide the transportation once they get over the walls. Sucre just got lucky really, as they share the same cell, but this comes up in the later episodes. L.J's 'You're such a bad role model' attitude sucks. Maricruz agrees to marry Sucre ONLY if a) they wait until he gets out of Fox River, and b) the wedding is in a church. A catholic church And oh look, they only have sixteen more months to wait! Lincoln thinks he's an anchor who drags people down. Best pilot ending, ever!Verdict : Great pilot with so many great characters introduced from the get go. Absolutely love this programme and can't wait for the new season!

No.28 -- Dr. Sara comes to Warden Pope to show the piece of fabric of uniform that she found in Michael's burnt believing he was tortured by a guard. Pope presses Michael, and without any answer, he sends him to the solitary confinement. Captain Rednick includes the rat David in the P.I. team trying to discover what they are plotting; the group is informed that on the next day, a team of specialist will put the carpet on the floor and they decide that Sucre is the only one capable to escape during the night to close the hole. Meanwhile in the US Secret Service Field Office in Chicago, Kellerman discovers that Lincoln's father belonged to the agency. Nick, Veronica and LJ return to Nick's cottage to get Quinn's cellular, and LJ finds that Quinn wrote "Kellerman o Kravecki" in the well, but he does not disclose the information to Veronica and Nick. LJ finds the address of Owen Kravecki and goes to his house to kill him. Michael has a psychological breakdown in the confinement and is sent to the asylum where he meets Haywire.In "J-Cat", the smart Michael plots a mean to reach Haywire simulating a psychological breakdown. Sucre is also bright creating an alibi in case he is discovered by the guards. I was disappointed with LJ attitude, hiding key information from Veronica and Nick. The despicable David deserves his fate in the end. The Machiavellian Vice President shows no scrupulous in a perfect characterization of most politicians of the world. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Surto" ("Breakdown")

No.29 -- Not only is this episode one of the best Theodore 'T-Bag' Bagwell episodes from Prison Break, in my opinion, it comes close to one of the best episodes from the whole series.Things are getting really intense in the penultimate episode of season 2. The Company are using Mahone AND T-Bag to lay a trap in yet another effort to try and capture Michael and Lincoln, but the change in strategy and mysterious 'Sona' previously mentioned linger in the mind as to their true agenda. Michael, feeling guilty and burdened for ever putting T-Bag out on the streets in the first place feels it's his responsibility to make sure 'that bird is put back in the cage' and temporarily abandons his plan to take care of the unfinished business. What follows is 45 minutes of intense action, suspense, shocking moments and twists and not to mention one hell of a chase before a dramatic showdown between Michael and T-Bag. This episode really shows the extent and brutal lengths to which T-Bag will go to survive, stay on the outside and get what he wants - not caring who gets caught in the crossfire. It's wonderful acting on both parts as these two characters who have nothing but resentment for each other; finally bring their rivalry to a head...

No.30 -- This episode really deserves its title because there were a lot of gun fights. I didn't mind them as action cooled off in the past episodes but I found one scene specially disturbing. In fact I prefer when a conflict is solved without violence. Anyway some of the scenes should remind you of films like The Professional (Léon), Point Break and even The Matrix. In one of them Lincoln dropped a line you won't resist because it was just too funny considering the context and the character he said it to. Also in the past episode the brothers were framed so they had to escape, again, and it was interesting to see if they would continue to work against each other or team up. I let you appreciate the path they chose. For once I was also glad that the story focused on Self because he's part of the team after all. Beside that T-Bag tried his best to convince the General that he's a worthy asset and not a psycho-clown. Last but not least the episode ended with a cliffhanger, again. However last time I thought the writers wouldn't be able to surpass it but believe me, they actually did.

No.32 -- After escaping from the cemetery with FBI Agent Mahone on their tail, Michael steals a bag of food from a couple that were on a picnic. After they ate, Michael gives Sucre and C-Note money to start a new life. Abruzzi asks for Fibonacci, but Michael refuses to give him this information. They end up leaving. Liconln learns in the newspaper that his son, LJ has a hearing in a courthouse to decide if he gets tried as an adult and he believes is the only chance to get him out. Meanwhile, Mahone attempts to use LJ to lure Scofield and Burrows. Warden Pope and Brad Bellick begin to feel disappointed once the case is handed over to the FBI and also when former CO, Geary tells on Bellick for selling PI to Abruzzi, which was the main reason why the inmates escaped in the first place. LJ receives a phone call from Liconln saying "I'm the third look out for Otis right" This is revealed later as a plan to get LJ out once he is on a elevator. Mahone tracks the call and knows that Michael and Liconln are trying to pull something off. He realizes it when he looks at a sign saying "Otis Manufactoring". Michael and Liconln try to get LJ, but Mahone sounds the alarm and manages to keep LJ with him. The police begin to pursuit Burrows and Scofield as they get into a car.

No.34 -- Now Brad is dead I can't believe how the other characters react. It's like if they all love him. He saved Sucre's life in Panama. He's a real hero. Let's just admit he did his time, that's why the writer decided to drown him. Moreover new characters were introduced so it's all for the best.T-Bag's speech was disappointing but he was smart enough to notice Trishanne's mistake, mentioning James Whistler when she's not supposed to know him. However the next scene we saw her entering Agent Self work place and I thought it was an awkward way to reveal her double role. I mean the writers should have let it go so the viewers can think about it and imagine all sort of things. Prison Break is a lot about the mind after all ! David Parker, Scylla's room architect, could be a great addition to the team so I hope he'll stick around for a few episodes. It would make sense as the closer they get to Scylla the more dangerous it gets. So they'll probably need him to neutralize some of its security gadgets. It reminds me of Impossible Mission best moments. Don't breath. Don't touch the floor I can't wait to see how Michael solves that new puzzle, if he's able to considering his health. Mahone helped with the letters puzzle and is very smart too but probably not as smart as Michael, he's the true master mind after all.I can't believe the General trusts Gretchen now she's back. It doesn't make sense. Who wouldn't turn their back on the Company after what they have done to her ? There's no way she'll work for them again. So I think she's gonna stick to her plan, bringing the Company down. Considering his role I think the General is too naive. I also couldn't believe the mine Sucre stepped on had a manual override and didn't explode instantly. It doesn't make any sense for such a high security area. It should be die hard to get to it.

No.35 -- Sara meets Michael and Lincoln in a train station in Evansville, Indiana; when she sees Kellerman with them, she becomes disturbed and upset. Kellerman tells that she has a key of a private cigar club in Chicago. Caroline calls Kellerman and he tells that he is heading to Chicago by train, and she promises his life back, inclusive the chief of staff position. T-Bag tells Susan that they are passing through an "adjustment period" in their lives; when she tells him that she will have a guest called Patty Wallace, T-Bag welcomes Patty with a magnificent family brunch and uses the strong father figure to discipline Zack, seducing the guest with his charm and attitude. Wheeler is reporting the actions of Mahone to the FBI Headquarter and they find that Haywire killed a man in Algoma, Wisconsin. Mahone visits Bellick in River Fox, releases him using a habeas-corpus to make his dirty work, and gives a car, a pistol and an FBI badge to the despicable man. Bellick chases and traps Haywire, and waits for Mahone. In Benson, Minnesota, C-Note and Dede are leaving a snack bar when an addicted thief announces a heist. When Kellerman sees a road block on the train, he realizes that he was betrayed.In this good episode, Bill Kim lures the unreliable and dangerous Kellerman using his juvenile passion for Caroline; however, he associates the last actions and discovers the truth in the last moment. The traumatized Sara and Michael are finally together and in love for each other. T-Bag is very seductive and easily lures the naive Patty with his attitudes. C-Note shows character and how unfair is his sentence, saving the waitress of the snack bar from the drugged robber. Mahone seems to have unlimited power, not only releasing the scum Bellick but also giving power to him. The demented Haywire is finally set free and even Mahone seems to have felt how ill the guy was. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Chicago"

No.36 -- Robert Knepper is a phenomenal actor. He artfully garners the disgust and loathing of his audience during the entire season. I cannot imagine another actor who could've played his role better. That vile little thing that he does with his tongue when he's about to put emphasis on his twisted perception of the world. In this episode, you can watch him turn his character's psyche and mentation on a dime. There is a very tender scene in this episode and it is delightful to watch Robert Knepper to give his character such incredible depth and dimension.

No.37 -- I loved the show but I feel bad for characters like Michael and Tweener! they didn't really do anything yet they died in such brutal ways! characters like T-Bag and Kellerman killed dozens of people for no particular reason and at the end they both end up leaders (One in politics, the other in crime) i understand why Mahone got a happy ending because he already lost his son and he only did bad things because they were holding his family as leverage! even though i love the show i think them two got off a little easy, even though Gretchen and T-Bag practically got the same punishment Gretchen suffered having to lose her daughter and being tortured ! personally i think they should have let Kellerman die off in the season 2 finale and T-Bag should have been the one who got paralyzed instead of Self or he got his other hand chopped off and had to spend the rest of his days in a disabled facility! Linc, Sucre, Sara and C-Note all got good endings that suited them but T-Bag and Kellerman got off way to lite!

No.38 -- Sara injects another shot and tells Michael that he needs a doctor. The lookout Lincoln keeps watching on the outside of the warehouse; when Self throws gas bombs trying to force Michael and his group to leave the place, Lincoln surprises Self, hits him on his back and brings him into the warehouse. Self justifies that his motivation was not personal, just business, and proposes to sell Scylla and share the amount among the whole group; however Gretchen appears out of the blue and balances the situation and they leave the place without a shootout. Meanwhile, Mahone meets agent Lang and tells her what happened in the last days, and asks who would be trustful in FBI since the agency and the National Security are compromised with infiltrated agents from The Company. General Krantz decides to chase Gretchen using a satellite; Lisa gives her resignation letter to he father. Michael does not want to sell Scylla; Sucre hides himself in the truck of Self's car and finds the low budget Fauntleroy Hotel where Self and Gretchen are lodged. He calls Michael and steals several cartridges of gas from the car. Michael hides the missing chip of Scylla on the ceiling of the bathroom, but Self sees the location using a camera he planted in the warehouse. Self calls T-Bag and asks him to kill Rita and Emily if he does not return the call within two hours. When the seller Ralph Becker arrives on the front door selling Bibles, T-Bag sees his ring and knock-outs the guy, telling Rita that he is a Company agent. He interrogates the man and Rita convinces T-Bag to release Ralph and T-Bag lets Emily and Rita go. However the seller is actually an agent and T-Bag is arrested by The Company. Meanwhile Mahone has a meeting with Agent Wheeler, asking to see someone to trust; Wheeler proposes the Scylla per a meeting with thee General Attorney. General Krantz also locates Gretchen and Self in the hotel, but Sucre fights against Gretchen while Michael disassembles the emergency exit; when Self leaves the room through the fire stairway trying to escape, he falls on the ground and Michael recovers the complete Scylla; however, he starts bleeding though his nose and faints. Self retrieves Scylla and The Company catches Michael. Sara and Sucre see on the screen of Self's notebook the hidden camera in the warehouse. When they return to their hideout, they find that Self has found the chip. When Mahone calls Lincoln and finds that Scylla was lost, he is betrayed by Agent Lang and arrested by Wheeler. Lincoln surprisingly arrives at The Company to see Michael, and General Krantz proposes the best doctors and facility to Michael's surgery per Scylla, and gives a file named Tombstone II to Lincoln. Meanwhile Self kills the intermediate Vikan and his bodyguard to deal Scylla directly with the buyer."Just Business" is a stalled episode, with many exaggerated twists and betrayals. If Michael and his group wanted a meeting with a trustful authority, why not the General Attorney Cooper Green they met on the episode "Wash"? The bad timing rules this show: Michael faints in the exact moment he has the complete Scylla; Lincoln unexpectedly hits Self and the whole group is surprised by Gretchen; why Sucre would try to dominate a skilled killer like Gretchen with bare hands, when a weapon should have resolved the whole problem. Why Mahone would schedule a meeting with his opponent, the ambitious Agent Mark Wheeler, without having Scylla? It would be more reasonable if he had helped Michael, Sucre, Lincoln and Sara first to retrieve and schedule an encounter with Wheeler later. When T-Bag does a good deed, he is betrayed.

No.41 -- Michael, Lincoln and Sara listen to the conversation taped in the pen-driver. Lincoln calls Jane Phillips to know who would be reliable to receive the tape, and he talks to LJ that tells him that he is back to school in Pullman, Washington. Jane recommends the former attorney general Cooper Green. Bellick goes to the FBI Chicago Field Office to press Mahone to pay the reward for Haywire. Kellerman buys an illegal rifle and kills the buyer; then he visits his sister Kristine. In Birmingham, Alabama, T-Bag meets the psychologist Dr. Stammer not for therapy but to use his identity due to the resemblance of Dr. Stammer with him. Bellick visits Manche to find where Sucre is hidden in Mexico. Lincoln contacts Cooper Green through his receptionist and schedules a meeting in the Ebert Park in Chicago, but he is tailed by Bill Kim's men. Kim calls Mahone telling where Michael is and Mahone tells C-Note that there is a change of plans and he does not need him anymore. Mahone concludes that Lincoln is innocent and sends a package with a rope asking C-Note to hang himself; in return, he would take care of Kacee and Dede. Sara visits her father's grave and meets Bruce that is waiting for her and explains that he is loyal to her. They go to Cooper Green's office and Sara discovers that Michael and Lincoln have been lured by Bill Kim. Bellick and T-Bag fly to Mexico in the same flight while Sucre and Maricruz are in love in the middle of nowhere. Sara brings Cooper Green to meet the brothers and he concludes that the tape is useless as evidence, but the brothers could blackmail Caroline and get the presidential pardon. Mahone concludes that Michael and Lincoln are in the hotel nearby the Ebert Park and finds that Sara has lodged in room 1006.In this great episode, the conversation in the tape is not disclosed, but it seems to be serious and compromising revelations about President Caroline. It is good to see Tina Holmes from "Six Feet Under" back on the screen. The coincidence of T-Bag and Bellick in the same flight to Mexico is unrealistic. The non-acceptance of the tape as evidence is another exaggeration of the justice system. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "O Acordo" ("The Deal")

LJ calls Lincoln, and Veronica uses a petition to permit Lincoln to see his son. Trixie fires Kellerman from the Secret Service, but he is supported by the Vice-President. While seeking a charger for Quinn's cell phone, Nick is pressed by a man to give information about Veronica. Michael is forced to give a name to Pope, and Michael gives the name of Geary. The petition works and Lincoln can see his son; while traveling in a van with escorted by armed guards, they are hit by a large towing truck.In this great episode, Michael succeeds in completing the map using Haywire and accuses Gegary. The despicable Geary is expelled from Fox River by Warden Pope. Why Nick is close to Veronica is not clear yet.

No.43 -- I totally loved the show. It contains good acting, excitement, little bit of love (required by some) and I have to say it's original. Every episode ends with a cliffhanger. But watching this final episode left me with this empty feeling, like I was missing something. You want it to end all good (well at least for most of them) and it looks like it works out fine, but then they stuff it up by ending this ep by yet another cliffhanger... so many questions, so few answers.... So after 45+ minutes (great length just to watch it on your way to work I have to day) you are left with this unsatisfied feeling. Have to say that's a little bit of a shame, but then again.... I can't wait for season 2!! that is going to be something!! All in all... great show and although unsatisfying yet another magnificent episode!

No.45 -- Lincoln tracks his son, sitting under the FBI noses - and they don't see him. He manages to save his son, with a "brilliant" plan - FBI lose again. Scofield acts with Sucre a little robbery scene and in the end are fooled by "T-Bag" - he is probably a BAG expert. Bellick is back and he easily gets information to be back in the picture. I'm sorry to disappoint the fans out there. This show is becoming too stupid. Again, people are killed like flies, shooting them in the street - FBI seems to be all powerful. Everybody is running around and it's making me sick - and all for nothing - just to make us watch. Scofield every episode is stuck because of some stupid obstacle (A wooden log this time). Everybody cheats everybody - power struggles - the magic charm of the first season is lost. I am really getting tired with every episode on the second season, that sets you forward one step and brings you backwards two steps.

No.46 -- Actually, not much, since the show was canceled because it lost 1/3 of it's audience during this abysmal season. This also explains the low number of users (around 375 per episode) who have rated each episode - others simply couldn't bother waste their time on this garbage that defiles the memory of the rather good first season. Thus, the ratings of the episodes are skewed because most of the people who rated the episodes were rabid fans with serious positive bias towards this show. Whereas I have no bias.This really was a good show during it's first season, and it's sad to see it sink this low. Everything is not only completely built on bull**** at this point, it is just unengaging and... boring. Episodes ago, Michael was diagnosed with a condition that needed IMMEDIATE surgery, yet he just keeps on trucking with the aid of injections, day after day, and when Sara tells him his dosage needs to be increased, Michael declines because of the side effects - apparently he can do just fine without ANY medication. You have to be an idiot to buy into this.Everything is just revolving around like a merry-go-around, some of the passengers just change. What's worse, the writers sideline their best character, Bagwell. Big mistake. The good thing is that Gretchen gets the spotlight and we get *actual* insight into her character. When has anything like that happened to any character in this show the last time? Also, she gets a bitching (tee-hee!) fight with Sucre which is the only high point in this predictable episode. Lots and lots of shooting guns here, yet no one hits no one. How bad are the highly trained agents and mercenaries? Yes, Prison Break is hardly the sole guilty party of this kind of unrealism, but at least in, for example, "24" people manage to hit their targets...So, the "big" surprise is that Michael gets caught by the Company. Whoopee! What a shocking turn of events. I am just unable to see where this is going next. No, wait, I'm not (and I haven't read the plots of the following episodes anywhere) - there's more bargaining and exchanges that always seem to go awry. Like I said, this is like a merry-go-around, they just keep changing the object (inanimate or animate) of the transaction. Why so I put up with this? Because maybe some potential future viewers/box set buyers will be convinced this show just ain't worth it anymore, hasn't been since season 2. I'll give this 4/10 - Gretchen's part would have made this a 5/10, but the recycled garbage deducts another point. Honestly, who was surprised about the bible-man twist? Or that Mahone gets double-crossed? And who finds Self's ruthlessness at the end just a bit a stretch too far? Or... etc. etc.

No.47 -- Michael receives a conjugal visit from his wife Jasmine, who brings a credit card for him, actually an electronic master access card. Dr. Sara Tancredi sees Jasmine and feels upset with her discovery. Captain Bellick decides to investigate Jasmine. Michael seeks his personal belongings in the storage room and finds that a gold watch is missing; he find that a security guard has stolen it from his box, and he asks the newcomer inmate David to retrieve the watch.

However, Michael realizes that seven runaway will spend much time to break up than available.This episode discloses surprises and twists: first, of course, is the marriage of Michael and the reaction of Sara. The planning of Michael is very impressive, using a well-planned gadget to get the information about the guard patrol. DB joining Michael's team, the friction between T-Bag and C-Note and the excessive number of fugitives is another great sub-plot. The fate of sadistic psychopath Quinn is awesome, and I really enjoyed it. The despicable Bellick will certainly jeopardize Michael's plan.

No.49 -- The pilot episode did a good job of "laying the foundation" for the story and filling us in on all of the essential background details. The story was interesting enough to make me want to see more but it all seemed a little emotionally flat. It wasn't incredibly gripping, engaging, or as intense as I would have expected given the seriousness of the subject matter.I found some of the details regarding prison life very unrealistic. Many times our main character was uncuffed around unarmed personnel, or like the scene where a prisoner gets a private room for an intimate meeting with his fiancé. What warden of a maximum security prison can be bribed over a popsicle stick sculpture? Do you really need to be an engineer to build one of those? Why is there always a corrupt catholic priest?It is not very original. Also prison (especially of this caliber) is definitely not TV-14 rated. While is is not necessary to make shows extremely obscene, a little more roughness/crudeness would make this scenario more believable. The tattoo revealing at the end was a nice finishing touch and was probably the most intriguing scene. Overall, it was just okay which is not a good sign as this is currently the seventh highest rated episode in the series. But with that, I am curious enough to keep watching.

No.50 -- Lincoln tells Michael that Sara is pregnant but he schedules a meeting with Christina in a shipyard; he prepares a bomb trying to lure her, but she escapes alive. Then Mahone calls her and tells that he has Scylla and he demands protection for Pam and Lincoln alive for Scylla. However he brings a device ready to explode. Michael lures General Krantz and rescues Sara. Self awakes in the hospital and he is interrogated by the Security Government agents and he proposes a deal with the Attorney General. C-Note meets Sucre and tells that the mysterious Paul proposes clean record for them per Scylla. They travel to Miami trying to reach Michael and his team.In this episode, there are many twists and I confess that I am tired of this cat-and-mouse situation. Out of the blue, Sucre and C-Note return to the show with the support of the mysterious "Paul". My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available

No.52 -- I've been waiting ages to read the reviews on here but stayed away for any potential spoilers. I've got to say, I'm genuinely shocked to see so much negativity around this season. Personally, I thought it was great. Loved every second. Was it too over the top sometimes? "F..." yeah! Would I have it any other way? Hell no!And to that grade-a idiot who mentioned that there was 5 seconds of reused material in the last episode from the very first episode, just take a step back and think. Seriously, just THINK.

No.55 -- After all these weeks of hiatus I almost forgot everything about Prison Break. However the first minutes quickly managed to refresh my memories and the story was right back on track. The interesting part is that Michael and Lincoln are nearly working against each other and the Company are using these new antagonistic characters at their advantage. But for the General it's not as easy as before considering the new enemies he has. So all these elements make the story even more catchy but there're still many others that bother me. For example I found the episode rather long when it had the usual duration. It's a bad thing because it means it was a bit boring. Maybe it was the whole Michael and Sara plot because I don't believe anymore in their relationship. It's always about Michael and not about Sara when developing both characters would be far much more interesting. Moreover seeing Michael pulling out smart solutions, like a MacGyver, is not as appealing as it used to be. Otherwise Lincoln and his wacky team saved the episode, specially T-Bag and Alex. In fact I can't wait to see what William Fichtner will do once Prison Break is over because he's such a charismatic and talented actor !So to sum things up I'm sure fans are glad Prison Break is back. Because even if some things got old there're still many things to appeal the audience. Moreover this episode ended with a cliffhanger so we better stay tuned

No.56 -- Directed by two-time Emmy director and cinematographer, Michael Watkins, of 'Quantum Leap' and 'X-files' fame, this episode maintained the pace and quality of its earlier pilot, while building to a series of finales, all of which would more than suffice alone to make this a far above average TV serial. One strand of the story- line concerns the ongoing re-investigation of Lincoln's case by Michael's attorney, and Lincoln's former girlfriend, Veronica Donovan. A recognisable face from her roles in 'The Craft' and 'Vertical Limit', Robin Tunney struggles to bring a level of credibility to her character, given the latter's propensity to oscillate radically in her interpretation of Burrow's guilt or innocence in line with the latest shred of evidence. Accessing video evidence from Lincoln's trial lawyer, comprising security camera footage from the scene of the crime, Veronica is dismayed to clearly witness her ex approach the deceased vice-president's brother's car and open fire. Yet, when she challenges him, he is adamant that he was framed, shocked to discover both the victim there, and that the man was already dead. Given that Lincoln remains the only one with motive enough, having been sacked by, and having had a public fracas with the victim, it becomes imperative that Veronica track down the only individual who could corroborate the reason why he was present and armed at the scene. Back at Fox River, at the commencement of this second episode, a race riot appears imminent, and despite Scofield's assurances that all details of the escape plan have been thoroughly worked out to account for all eventualities, Lincoln counters his brother's self-confidence by warning that the one factor which cannot be so controlled concerns the unpredictability of people, especially in such a volatile environment. Once again written by the show's creator, this episode makes evident Burrow's words of caution, with individuals aplenty who pose both a physical threat, and a risk to the success of Scofield's schemes. The first of these is kidnapper, rapist, murderer, and white supremacist, Theodore 'T-Bag' Bagwell. With a penchant for young handsome inmates, Scofield attracts his unwanted attention while attempting to extract a bolt from one of the bleachers under this ruthless sexual predator's control: 'All you gotta a do is take this pocket right here, and ya life'll be all peaches and cream'. In attempting to retrieve this vital component in his escape plan, he has it confiscated by 'T-Bag' for refusing the latter's advances, and in being caught trying to recover said item from T-Bag's cell Scofield feigns interest in participating in the forthcoming conflict with the African American prison populace. Witnessed seemingly choosing the supremacists' side, Scofield draws the animosity and distrust of his fixer 'C-Note', thereby, placing at risk the supply of the drug Pugnac, necessary to suppress his insulin levels to get access to the infirmary. As if the menace posed by fellow prisoners at Fox River is not sufficient, Scofield also invites the wrath of the commanding officer of the prison guards, Brad Bellick, for enjoying the protection of Keach's prison warden: 'He may run this place during the day, but I run it during the night.' Veronica's continued delving into the case leads to the coming forward of the crucial witness' terrified girlfriend, who reveals that Lincoln's witness died not long after his conviction, victim of an overdose, an impossibility given the fact his heart condition precluded him from being a drug user. It also draws the unwelcome attention of the sinister Secret Service team, and their as-yet unidentified female boss who gives them sanction to remove all encumbrances to Burrows' execution. Secondly, the tinderbox at Fox River is lit and in the ensuing melee scores are settled and as the guards begin to reassert their control, 'T-Bag' is horrified to see his lifeless and bloodied 'girlfriend' draped over Scofield. The audience are witness to 'T- Bag's' unnerving howls swearing vengeance after lockdown, while Scofield starts working in his cell on the bolt he stripped from the 'girlfriend's' grasp. Finally, the significance of the episode's title is revealed as Scofield fashions the bolt into an allen key to start dismantling the toilet unit at the rear of his cell. As if all these plot developments are not enough, Abruzzi, under pressure himself from his mob bosses to discover Fibronacci's whereabouts, loses patience, and in his desperation has his 'heavies' inflict an injury on Scofield which almost rivals the shock value of Peter Stormare's 'wood chipper' moment in 'Fargo'. Still, this is indubitably Robert Knepper's episode in which he amply demonstrates his acting talent and takes hold with both hands this opportunity to shine in the memorable role of 'T-Bag', so disturbingly capturing the menace of one of the most monstruous villains ever portrayed on the small screen. As Knepper later recounted, he was intending to quit acting as the industry was so hard to break into, but upon declaring this intention to fellow gym client, Kiefer Sutherland, the latter punched him and told him never to give up. Our gain.

No.57 -- Just one question: why was Paul Adelstein cast as Paul Kellerman (uncredited) on IMDb for this episode, while he did not show up, even in a flashback?Interesting question?Was he going to appear in the episode and then the guys at Fox changed their mind?As we all know, we never actually saw Kellerman "getting killed" in the Season 2 finale; we only saw some guys shooting in a van from a far.Well, I guess we'll have to wait for the rest of the episodes (when?) to know. But share your ideas if you will.

No.59 -- I thought the episode moved too quickly. Too many things happened in a single episode, so much so that at times it felt like a summary of several episodes. The result is that not enough attention was given to character and story development. The original Prison Break's success was partly due to meticulous attention to detail and story line simmering, which was almost ignored in the new opener. Mike did not have to show up in the first episode, yet half way through it was obvious he was going to. There is a naivety and repetitiveness in Mike ending up in prison again, which the series must tackle carefully. Some parts of T-Bone's reintroduction were silly, so much so that at times he came across as stupid. He may be evil, coy and calculating but stupid he is not. Slow down...

If i were you id buy the box set because you really don't want to miss this. It was on late and my best bits were when T-Bag got his hand chopped of by John with a axe he is my favourite character and I'm a wuss i started to cry. and the other best bit was when they made it to the runway but the plane went over there heads and i sensed the disappointment. Next season next year i don't know about you but i am certainly not going to miss this. Its on next year a long wait but if you get the box set its easy to follow good luck Schofield

No.63 -- This episode reminded me how much i liked the old seasons of prison break. It's a classic example of the fact that nothing is what it seems to be. I'll try not to reveal any spoilers.After some episodes that just dragged the action of this season, I was beginning to lose interest in the show. And even though not everything ties perfectly with the end of season 4, this episode did a fantastic job at revealing things and setting up other things for the final episode. There are a few moments of Scofield classic in this episode and some revelations that will surprise you and in fact will make sense. But the end of the episode is what made it great and left me wanting so bad to see the finale. There are a lot of surprises in this episode and cliffhangers that just reminded me of how good the beginning of the series was. In conclusion I'll say this was at first sight the best episode of prison break ever, up there with "Go" and "Selfless" which in my opinion were the best ever. Although a lot of people trashed this series for being dragged and being empty with nothing happening, I'm glad I had the patience to wait and see probably the best episode of prison break ever in my opinion!

They seemed too lucky so far but the plot got really better with this episode. After killing the Italian mob leader and David who fell in love with the girl whose car he shared to get to Utah, mahone pledged to kill the rest of the escapees. Kellermann got retired by the administration after Sara managed to escape. Bellick has become one of the inmates in Fox River as the murderer of Geary who was actually killed by Bagwell but since Geary double crossed Bellick, the court thought he's the culprit. While they were being transported Kellermann helped them get away as his life was devastated too just like theirs and shot mahone. And also the father of the brothers who abandoned them for the sake of the firm which made them hostile towards the administration got killed by mahone and died on the way to hospital and they buried him in the middle of the desert.

No.66 -- In LA, General Krantz tells Wyatt that he wants Michael, Lincoln and Mahone dead. Agent Self forces Michael and his crew to wear monitor around their ankles, and their first assignment is to find the Scylla card. Mahone recalls that Whistler delivered the card to a card holder, and he noted that the driver probably would be a retired military. Using the information from the IRS, they find the identity of the driver. Meanwhile, T-Bag and Sancho head to San Diego in the desert. The hungry Sancho attacks T-Bag, who kills the Mexican while defending himself, and survives eating part of him. Later he gets a ride to San Diego with two bikers' sportsmen. Michael's team tracks the driver to the fortress of Spectroleum CEO Stuart Tuxhorn. The hacker Roland Glenn joins the team and gives a digital black hole device that copies any digital information when close to the source. Michael asks Sara to plant the device in the housekeeper's purse to bring the device inside the house and they succeed in copying the card. However, the maid leaves the device inside the house and they are forced to break in the place to retrieve the apparatus. T-Bag discovers the meaning of Whistler's code 36-24-36 in the Birds Guide. Michael and Sara conclude that Scylla is actually a six head monster from "The Odyssey" and therefore there are six cards. Gretchen is still alive.In this engaging second episode, a new member joins Michael's team, the hacker Roland Glenn. The cold blood killer Wyatt is the new menace to the group.

No.67 -- The most significant event in this episode is that Lincoln tells the world, as well as us, what "The Company" is. "They are a group of multinationals with corporate interests." "They are working with the highest levels of government, including the president of the United States." I believe Prison Break is one of the earlier shows that came up with this idea. Heroes's version of The Company developed in about 2007 and 2008. 24's version of a group of people who control the government and the President of the United States appeared in 2006 and 2007. Prison Break, on the other hand, had this idea from the beginning, and here, during the 15th episode of season 2, it finally gave "The Company" a formal definition, through the words of Lincoln and Michael.The characters continue to live in a very dark state, and the cast really look believable in their performances. Bill Kim never gets a break in his life, does he? It's like he has to respond to every event that ever happens in the world. Bellick just keeps getting into trouble and yet keeps finding ways to improve his situation. He's becoming a lite version of T-Bag, who just keeps surviving under horrible circumstances. How does Bellick even know all that about the Alcoholics Anonymous book anyway? Either he is an incredible reader who knows about a lot of books, or he has been in the AA program himself. Either way, it adds tremendous depth to his character. When you think about it, it makes sense that none of the federal agents in Mahone's office knows about this book. They are professionals who don't have drinking problems. When Bellick works with Mahone and provides his "street wisdom", that the academic people don't have, you see the strength of the low-lifes.Finally, Haywire is still alive. The writers decided to keep him going for a good part of the second season. There's a moment of foreshadowing in this episode. When Lincoln talks about Alex Mahone's history with the fugitives he has gone after before, we see Haywire on screen. Eventually Mahone will find Haywire, and history will probably repeat itself again. Before the inevitable downfall of Haywire, the writers gave him a moment to shine, to kill an abusive father and restores at least some amount of justice to this dark and desperate world.Kaley Cuoco's appearance in this episode was forgettable. She just doesn't fit in a show with such strong acting. Her character, like most characters on the show, has dark issues. But unlike other characters, she wasn't able to convey that in her performance. This was Kaley before The Big Bang Theory, her big break. Maybe she got better as an actress in that show. I don't know. Actors do get better sometimes. Wentworth Miller also couldn't act when he appeared on Ghost Whisperer and still couldn't act during season one of Prison Break. This year he got a lot better. I believe that working with so many talented actors, especially William Fichtner, has pushed him to develop his skills.

No.68 -- Lincoln proposes to crash the General's car to copy the last card using the trick he did in 2001, in Chicago, to rob a wallet. Michael tells Sara that Gretchen is alive and dealing with Agent Self a partnership together with T-Bag. Sara is disturbed with the new partner and recalls the torture she was submitted, whipped on her back. Roland sends an untraceable message to Wyatt asking how much he would pay for Michael and Lincoln. Mr. Feng visits T-Bag in his office in Gate, but Gretchen negotiates Scylla for US$ 125 million, offering US$ 25 million to T-Bag. Lincoln plans the accident with Sucre while Lincoln and Michael rob an ambulance in a federal yard. Gretchen gives a message to Self inviting Sara to meet her in a motel room. Sara is worried with Michael's health. Roland tells Wyatt where Michael and Lincoln are, and the killer shots Sucre. Michael presses Roland that denies being a rat. Self makes clear to Gretchen and T-Bag that they are scum. T-Bag plots with Trishanne against Gretchen. Gretechen proposes a cease-fire to Sara, and she asks about Michelle Taylor. Roland removes the GPS monitor and escapes to meet Wyatt, who shots his knees. Roland gives the address of the warehouse in Pier 31, San Pedro, but Michael, Lincoln, Bellick and Mahone arrive just in time and capture Wyatt. The general concludes that the attempt was against his card and orders to move Scylla.The partnership of Michael's team with the cold sociopath Gretchen and the despicable T-Bag certainly will never work. In this episode, Sara discloses the reasons for her emotional disturbance with the recollection of her period of captivity and torture with Gretchen. Roland deserves his fate, and finally Mahone has captured Wyatt. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): Not Available

Abruzzi asks his outside man to kidnap James, but things go wrong and the mobster kills James and his five years old son Jimmy. Abruzzi feels guilty for the death of the child and feels the need of God's forgiveness, but T-Bag betrays Abruzzi like Judas. Meanwhile Veronica and LJ bring Nick to the hospital and while in surgery, LJ escapes to see the funeral of his mother. Daniel Hale sees the teenager in the cemetery but he does not arrest him; later he tells his wife that they should move to West and gives an anonymous call to Veronica scheduling a meeting in the Highland Cafe. Maricruz tells Sucre that she is pregnant but she will marry Hector. Captain Bellick presses David to rat Michael telling everything he says. Michael tests the escape plan and informs the group that they are ready to go that night, but Lincoln was sent to solitary confinement protecting his brother.In this tense episode there are many twists, but probably the most important is the reaction of Daniel Hale after seeing LJ grieving his mother. The situation between John Abruzzi and T-Bag is also promising. Captain Bellick is one of the most despicable villains I have ever seen and Wade Williams has amazing performance in the role of this scum guard.

No.70 -- Please read only after watching the episode Michael and Sara are chased by the Company's men; they hitchhike in a truck, but the driver is killed and they are trapped in the trunk. Meanwhile, Lincoln, Mahone, Self and T-Bag investigate the two sophisticated and expensive keys they took from the buyer that shot Gretchen. They find two possible addresses, and while Lincoln and Mahone goes to a mansion, Self and T-Bag heads to a church trying to find Scylla. Lincoln finds a picture from the 70's of his mother Christina and he unravels the secret message with the location where he might meet her. Meanwhile Christina orders an attempt against the life of General Krantz but he escapes with minor injuries only. Lincoln meets his mother and she asks two days for him to remove General Krantz from the direction of the Company and leave Michael and Lincoln free. When Lincoln decides to meet Christina again, his life is in serious jeopardy.After the long period without "Prison Break", I finally decided to see this series again, and I recapped watching the last episode again to remember how this series abruptly ended a couple of days before Christmas. The plot now is too complicated and I do not know how the author will resolve the story with a decent conclusion since neither General Krantz nor Christina are the "good guys" and it seems that it will be very difficult for Michael and Lincoln to get free in the end. The end of this show gives a glimpse of how much Christina cares for Lincoln. The last chance for a good resolution of "Prison Break" was when Self appeared like a representative of the government promising amnesty for the group. Now it seems to be very difficult to have a good solution due to the huge power of the Company, where everybody seems to be involved. The romance between the selfish and egocentric Michael and the sweet Sara has a total lack of chemistry and it would be better off if Sara had really died in the past. The character of Michael is now wasted, at least for me, and Mahone and Lincoln are saving the show. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available

No.76 -- Prison Break is, in my opinion, the best show on television since 24 began. It's masterfully written and keeps you guessing and always leaves you desperate for more. I highly recommend this show to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, you will not be disappointed.Michael Schofield is a successful, wealthy, very intellectual man with a good honest life and everything going right for him. Except for one thing... his brother Lincoln is imprisoned and set to be executed for the crime of murdering the Vice President's brother and Michael is convinced he is innocent.After all appeals have been exhausted, Michael knows the only way to save his brother's life is to break into Fox River and then break out... The episode begins showing only briefly what he has been planning and the extent to which he has researched everything about the prison, some of the inmates, and his plan. It seems to me like this works exceptionally well because we can see how he has the plan mapped out to every detail for the escape, and how to stay on the outside after breaking out, even before we ever see him. But as he beings implementing it throughout the season - each stage of it is new, engages the audience and you appreciate the brilliance of this man Michael Scofield. I don't want to rate the Pilot higher than 8 because I feel it goes into the plot too quickly, and Michael's incarceration feels rushed when it should have really being drawn out longer in the first episode. Nevertheless, it's still a very strong start for a very strong series.

No.77 -- Kellerman continues to impress with the versatility of his acting and Sucre and Sara are fun to watch. T-Bag does a good job of playing the creep but the main characters, Michael and Lincoln, are wearing very thin and the plot frustrates. Their breathy brooding and how they keep giving opportunities to the bad guys makes me want to stop watching:
1 Michael who is careful about most things takes a message board, which has been compromised, at face value. He leaves his get away and his brother to tie up a loose end.
2 Michael stakes out a tropical holiday scene with a dark hoody pulled up around but not hiding his very publicized face.
3 Mahone gets the better of Lincoln when he has him beat and a gun trained on him. Will this very camp manboy ever learn that saying "I swear to God, if you touch my brother" is not going to win him much?
4 Most annoyingly, they keep giving T-Bag so much slack to F them (and anyone else) over. They put him in the back of the car and he gets the upper hand, yet again, plunging a screwdriver into a distracted and ever-emotional Sucre.
5 Although they outnumber and outwit him and he has no authority, the crew follows the foolish (but funny) Bellick into a trap and let him be caught without finding out where he has had MariCruz locked up for a week. Really?
I need to get some payback soon for my patience because, after about 40 episodes, its wearing nearly as thin as this plotline.

No.78 -- In Tribune, T-Bag cut off his hand to escape from the police. In Maljamar, New Mexico, Michael does not have enough money to buy a case of fishing reel oil and a GPS, and he robs the GPS. He has a crisis of conscience and confesses his sins to a priest in a church. In Trinidad, Colorado, Aldo tells Lincoln how the interests of the corporation are manipulating the government in a huge conspiracy. When the agent of Bill Kim tries to kill them, Lincoln fights with him and Jane saves Lincoln killing the infiltrated man. T-Bag locates Geary with a GPS in the bag of money in a fancy hotel and he kills him. Kellerman abducts and tortures Sarain a motel room trying to find what her father gave to her; later Bill orders him to kill her. Bill releases Mahone and threatens his son and with Shales case; he accidentally deciphers the code hidden in the name Bolshoi Booze. Michael attempts to lure the smuggler of immigrants Coyote and his gang delivering sugar and water instead of medical nitroglycerin. However, the test the product, finds the truth but Michael is saved by Sucre.In this episode, Mahone glancing the upside-down picture and deciphering the code by chance is absolutely exaggerated. Geary deserves his fate, and I believe that for the first time I cheered for T-Bag. The performance of Paul Adelstein in the role of Kellerman is impressive and I am anxious to know the fate of Sara. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Bolshoi Booze"

No.79 -- So the FBI agent is crazy... doing drugs and killing people - is there someone who is not into the conspiracy here? Why did he have to kill him? it ruined to me his image. I thought he was this sophisticated FBI agent who is dealing with a difficult past, and uses unorthodox methods to lead the investigation. But now he sinks too low - I don't like his character anymore. Of course they killed the governor - he was making too much problems. All those killings... it's way too much. It is getting completely unreliable. I think it's a trick to keep the audience watching this show - you wonder who will go next. The second season started OK - got better - and now this episode brings this show low. First season is still more awesome!

No.80 -- The previous episode was great and this one was even better. The brothers relationship was further developed. The story focused more on the mother and her complex personality. In fact I specially enjoyed the scene between her and Sara. As expected the General landed in Miami and clashed with Lincoln's team. The whole Scylla arc was also very interesting and the writing nearly fascinating. Even after everything that happened to them I wasn't expecting that. It's a twist ! A cliffhanger ? No it's a real break through !The dream ending the show deserves is happening right now. Viewers, you better stay tuned !

No.81 -- Episode 9 of what was now becoming an extremely popular TV series introduces another character to the season: David 'Tweener' Aploskis.The part is played excellently by a very unknown actor, Lane Garrison. The 18 year old and clearly naive Apolskis enters Fox River putting on his 'prison face'. Oblivious to the racial tensions within Fox River and clearly having little knowledge about how he should behave in a prison. Apolskis' sharp attitude, and desire to integrate with the black inmates quickly fuel resentment towards him from both the black and white inmates.Looking for fresh meat and a new boy to hold his pocket, T-Bag soon targets the confused and quickly isolated youngster giving him the nickname 'Tweener' and continues to pursue him with relentless sexual harassment. As Michael begins to feel a sense of responsibility to protect the boy from the ruthless T-Bag, he worries how to deal with him without risking him blowing the whistle on the escape plan. The part really is played wonderfully by Garrison as you see Tweener's confident and cocky exterior evident at the start of the episode broken down to the point where he's reduced to tears in his cell.In the meantime: the other escapees continue ploughing through the hole in the guards break room but problems are inevitably set to ensue as Falzone begins to put pressure on Abruzzi for the location of Fibonacci; and Bellick is threatening to take away his P.I privileges altogether...

No.82 -- The first episode of the new season of Prison Break was overall pretty good. Some of the dialogue was a little cheesy and a certain fight scene was as well. However, the tone of the show remains the same as it's always been. The episode has all the qualities of what made the show so lovable in the first place. It has plenty of suspense and there is never a dull moment as usual. Nothing will ever compete with the first season, but I think by the team this season is over viewers will be pleased that the show made a return.

No.83 -- That phrase surmises it all up. Because in this Prison Break episode, we start by seeing a exploded car on a ditch and agent Mahone is looking at it. But then, fade out and a title appears saying "12 hours earlier". During those 12 hours earlier, Michael and Lincoln show up at Nika's house to heal Lincoln's leg. Michael sets out to get his car back only to fine that it has been taken to a car deposit. By the pieces of glass on the street, Michael realizes that a window of the car was broken. In the car there was everything they needed to disappear, but now a bag that was on the back seat has fallen into the hands of Mahone, who finds a passport with Michael's face on it but only with some other name. Bellick goes to a store where he runs into Geary, who was working there after being fired. They start fighting but they ended up having a drink together. Bellick says he wants to get the reward they are offering for the FOX RIVER EIGHT. They agreed to work together in order to find them. For that, Bellick uses Manche who, quoting T-Bag, "sang like Johnny Cash". Meanwhile, C-Note makes a phone call to his wife from a payed phone. The FBI hears the conversation and learn that C-Note is asking his wife to meet him within a week. Also, Sucre steals a car after he found out that Maricruz is getting married with Hector. The police is on him, but he manages to escape by jumping on a train heading to New York. When he got there, a friend of him tells that Maricruz's wedding is taking place in Vegas, so Sucre takes his friend's motorcycle and goes to Vegas. Getting near to the end of this episode, Michael comes up with a plan to get Mahone off their back, so he makes a phone call on purpose so that Mahone will track it. Once they tracked the call, they tracked where they are and where they're going. They start persecuting them, but Michael and Liconln stop at the middle of a bridge, take some bagged flesh and put it on the car and push it over the bridge. The car explodes and they run uphill. They meet with Nika again, who offers her car to them so that they can go to Mexice. Blindly, they start their journey thinking that the Feds will pay attention on the other guys, but they had absolutely no idea that Bellick and Geary are right behind them, which becomes the start of a new persecution. So, maybe in the next to episode, someone's is gonna go down and who that might be, we don't know. It could be C-Note or Sucre. But wait, we still got T-Bag, Tweener and Abruzzi. The most likely to go down is C-Note, because by the end of the episode, his wife helps the feds to haunt him.

No.84 -- Ohh, my god!!!! I think, "Sweet Caroline" is one of the best episodes ever on "Prison Break"! I was shocked, really shocked and I am still in shock. I couldn't expect such things happened in this episode. The finale was awesome. Oh, Caroline, "Sweet" Caroline, why did you do so?! Now, I am sure, that there will be third season too. Because many things are going to happen and I don't know, really don't know, what the brothers are going to do. And who is this man, to whom spoke Bill Kim? He doesn't speak, he only writes. He is a very mysterious person and I hope, we will find some answers about him soon. So, Prison Break is still the best show I have ever seen!

No.86 -- Hi Cahit, I've read your comment on the episode and I don't understand how you can assert that Paul is inside Sara's home at the end of the episode. We can only see that there are some drugs displayed on the table next to the couch.In my view, the drugs were put here in order to attract Sara, shocked by her father's death, so that she take drugs and probably killed herself. I think that Paul actually don't want to hurt her. In the same episode, the supervisor tells Paul to focus on LJ and says that Sara's case would be handled by other men, suggesting that she would be killed.We can see on Paul's facial reaction that he may unexpectingly care about Sara.

No.87 -- Some spoiler. Those who are complaining that there isn't much of a story to come, well, that's the point. They are trying to give us a better ending to the show than what was given to us in the final break. I am more than happy with that. They could have just said 'forget it.' I am please with how the episodes are so far. I didn't expect Michael to get caught while breaking out and it made me wanting to see what happens next. I definitely think they're on the right track.

No.88 -- It was exciting..what exactly we expect from prison break fear surprises anxiety and all these things we feel during the episode so many twists, an awesome end like the old times and now we have a real villain thanks god, so of course the game is on because Poseidon is such a good villain like Mahone but more calm he is different but as good as Mahone. On the other hand now we learn some things about Michael's tattoos and we learn about Sofia yeah and we see c-note's daughter that's incredible , the same one of the old prison break of course she is old now but this is exactly the point and it's crazy. T-bag and whip dad and son who was waiting for this.. the only problem is the 9 episodes they are trying to put all this thing in such a little space and they can't you understand it

No.89 -- Season 3: In Third season now Michael Scofield with T - Bag, Mahone and Bellick is recaptured in Sona Panamian jail. Michael Scofiled must fight to survive inside Sona, a hellish Panamian prison where the only rule is brutal violence and the only way out is in a body bag.So, with time running out, Lincoln Burrows scrambles desperately to free his brother along with the only man who can deliver Lincoln's captive son from the sinister clutches of the Company. Third Season is so far the best one but in my opinion still dose not beat the second season but it was awesome and still is the best. Season 4 and Final Break ruined everything! Howcould they kill Brad Bellick and Michael Scofield? I was so shocked. Wade Willams was special quest only in 9.episodes after episode 10 he was cut off the show, you can see that he is a hero. In flashbacks we can see him when he was in Sona in Third Season than they killed Michael at the end of Season 4 and Final Break .In Season 3 Alexander Mahone tried desperately to come out of Sona including killing only person Whistler who can save LJ and Sara from the Company. T - Bag portrayed by one and only awesome Robert Knepper Theodore T - Bag Bagwell is so awesome. Robert is the best actor ever i am glad Kiefer Sutherland aka Jack Bauer punched him and told him never give up. Jodi Lyn O'Keefe as Susan B. Anthony aka Gretchen Morgan is terrific but scary a lot. She was better in this season than in season 4 she ever was.My favorite episodes are: Hell or High Water,Bang & Burn, Orientación,Fire/Water,Call Waiting,The Art of the Deal,Boxed In and Photo Finish. The season contains 13 episodes, and concluded on February 18, 2008. The season was shorter than the previous two because of the Writer's Guild strike.Season 1 DVD included 22 episodes, 6-disc set,Special features and Audio commentaries. Season 2 DVD included 22 episodes,6-disc set Special features, Audio commentaries. Season 3 DVD included 13 episodes , 4-disc set,Special features. Season 1 - 3 are the best and great too watch ever. Michael Scofield is a hero and his the only hero and Brad Bellick is a second hero in Prison Break and i love them both the most. They are both heroes and I idol them so much.In Season 4 Brad saved Sucre's life when T - Bag made a riot in Sona. The Best TV show on air ever it will always stay in my heart forever. I have Season 2 & 3 on DVD original DVD's only first one i don't have original DVD's. Bought Season 1 - 3 on DVD you wan't be disappointed! Prison Break 2005 - 2009

No.90 -- Prison break season one captured many peoples attention with hooks and gripping story lines. Much of that carried on into season 2. Then came season 3 which in all honesty was a little bit of a let down but season 4 has picked up and this episode touches the heart.They have made you care a lot about the characters and play on those feelings to the extent that i was shaking at the end of this episode. Characters you hated you feel for deeply and see past they're awful side.If you are a PB fan you can't not watch this episode.

No.91 -- I've had enough of this bs through out the entire season two.It's so apparent that the screenwriter deliberately made every character an idiot so as to cause drama and extreme predicable "twist". I watch every episode with a heart rate of 50 simply because the plot is so lame that doesn't even contain any thrill, yet it always causes my blood pressure sky high coz it's beyond stupidity!Every time these so-called "fugitives" finally lose their pursuers and meet up in front of some vehicle, they'd DEFINITELY take their time catching up with each other at their current location. It never occurs to them that they should talk on the road. They just have to decide that "hey, this is a great spot to chat! Let's hang out a while longer so that our pursuers can catch up!"And when their pursuers, driving a police car, do catch up with them, they would just ABANDON their vehicle, a boat on water, and decide that "hey, it's faster to run on foot than by vehicle! Because a police car obviously can float on water and outrun our boat!"This is literally the stupidest show I've ever seen!

No.92 -- Michael,Bellick and Mahone are in the same horrible prison named Sona. Sara shot Kim and Michael took the fall for her and Sara walked out. The bald man that Kim served for was interested in Michael's new prison break out of the Panama jail. Kellermann got in jail and so did Bagwell as the guys he helped in Mexico get Michael didn't bail him out. And the money bag is in the water near the boat where Sara shot Kim.

No.93 -- I typically love Prison Break but this episode just stunk. There was just too many implausibilities. The people that killed Kellerman and shot Sarah's husband are released on bail the next day?? That seemed so incredibly unlikely to me. The worst part of the episode is that Michael's group blew up the truck killing all those men, and their guns are laying there for the taking, and here comes another lunatic racing down the road towards them that they will need those guns against, and not one of the 4 men think to run up and grab some guns? Of course that would have killed the plot of the rest of the episode showing them run from said lunatic.

No.95 -- Sona's Commander General Zavala takes Michel and locks him in a "hot-box" in solitary confinement to be punished by law or by Panama's sun. Meanwhile Agent Lang brings Mahone back to Sona and gives an amulet to him that belonged to her father. Michael decides to tell the truth to General Zavala and he brings Whistler, who is submitted to torture and gives the name of Gretchen Morgan. Meanwhile Lincoln is blindfolded by Gretchen and has one minute of conversation with LJ. T-Bag proposes Mahone to kill Sammy; in return he would supply drugs for free for him. Bellick is challenged by Papa for a fight and he uses acetone to defeat his opponent. Gretchen is arrested and tortured by General Zavala and she gives the location of LJ. However she reverts the situation and kills Zavala. Augusto gives a pistol to Sammy and tells him that it is time to make a move."Boxed In" is another good but flawed episode of the Third Season. How could an experienced general travel with a dangerous prisoner in a hostage situation escorted by only one man? This situation is amazingly ridiculous.

Further, he asks his associates what should be selected: English, Fitz or Percy?

No.98 -- I was trying to decide what to choose for my 50th comment/review (the official term has changed back and forth around the time of writing), considering choosing one of my favorite movies. Then this episode came on and after having watched it I needed to vent my frustration.Some may wonder why I torture myself watching episodes which I find bad. The answer is simple: I have a principle of finishing what I started and I also refuse to surrender to an episode / a movie by switching channel / walking out.OK, this appears to be a fantastic episode because it's taut, full of good twists, action, suspense and laughs. Also, most of the actors bring their A game for their roles, the winner being Jodi Lyn O'Keefe as Gretchen: her character seemed so bland and unimaginative in the third season, but given a chance to portray someone willing to resort to anything to stay alive, she truly *rules* (not coming up with a fancy term would do her performance justice).So what's the problem? Prison Break had me from the first episode of season 1. The problem is the *fact* that the show was supposed to last only 13 episodes with a pre-planned ending, but when the initial ones proved a bigger success than anticipated, Fox decided to throw the ending away and expand Prison Break to a full season. And then renew it. And renew it. Kinda like The X Files - it was also a Fox show that was dragged on for longer that it had material to sustain the narrative (and that's just the "mythology" episodes - some of the stand-alone ones were recycled). In the case of both series the decisions came to money: why kill a cash cow when you can underestimate your audience's intelligence and throw all credibility out of the window?The problem is that this is no longer Prison Break. All the plot lines in the initial episodes were dropped because they had nowhere to go (remember, 13 episodes?) and replaced with a vague, sub-standard conspiracy plot line that was clearly made up as the show went on, with no pre-planned ending whatsoever. And now we are in the death rattle of the show. Seasons 2 and 3 at least dealt with a prison break - here there is none. Why the hell is this show still called Prison Break?To go into the inconsistencies, illogicalities and contradictions of the show would take more time than I am willing to spend. Because of those things, there is no reason to care about the characters or where the plot is going. There is no reason to invest emotionally or intellectually in the show. This show should have stayed its planned course. The viewers disappeared during the fourth season, proving that Fox underestimated their intelligence. Ha!

No.99 -- The final scene has haunted me constantly since seeing it... nothing has been able to get it out of my head. The futility, the utter and complete futility... Especially after the season 1 finale where Nick sacrificed his father's and his own life specifically to protect her. This was a disturbingly messed up way to terminate the legal action aspect of the story. We've watched Veronica and Nick follow the outside trails on this case for a long time. The sudden comedown from uneasy triumph to imminent and inescapable death -- I can't handle it.Pretty much everyone's death on this show has been utterly meaningless. (The Company guy is the only one who IMO deserved it). I don't think I can watch anymore. (I liked watching Michael execute and adapt his master plan, but I think even that will start to fade from the plot, with Mahone unraveling it rapidly.)I expect by the end of the series, out of Lincoln, Michael, and LJ, only one will still be alive. If that. As a result, I don't really see much point in watching how that happens.

No.101 -- Prison break 4 years run comes to an end (well sort of) with these double episodes (Rate of change/Killing your number). The previous episode really managed to up the bar and set up perfectly the last 2 episodes of the series.The first episode, Rate of change was pretty good. It was really that fantastic but it had some great moments. It was good to see Mahone have an important role. They try to play with the character, specially his motivations. T-Bag stole the show. Actually these 2 episodes had among the finest T-Bag moments I've seen in a long time. T-Bag-Sara scenes were superb. It was nice to see Sucre back as his initial send off some time back was far from satisfying. Cool to see C-Note too.2nd episode, killing our number was pretty good too. Again, as far the conclusion of the scylla arc is concerned, it was not that great but satisfactory. Kellerman (finally) returned! Even tho I knew he would, I was still like OMG! when he first appeared. Many fans (included me) would have considered this a loose end if he hadn't come back. He was no longer the cold blooded killer from the first 2 seasons but it was still cool. He is the one who actually saved the day. Little underwhelming really, best thing would have been to develop this earlier but the actor is contracted with ABC, so they did what they could here. T-Bag was again great here in his reunion with Sucre/C-Note. Sara kills Christina, Linc is freed, Scylla handed to UN, everybody was exonerated and the General arrested. It was good, felt a little rushed but it was good.So what make this series finale fantastic? What brought the finale feeling to it? What made it unforgettable? Well the answer to this is the closing 10 minutes of the show. It was really what mattered. To see where those characters we loved ended 4 years later.-Alex Mahone: My favorite character. Had a great first part of season 4. Less relevant in the 2nd half but was well used in the finale. William Fitchner has been amazing in those 3 seasons. I will check his future works for sure. Mahone ends up happywith Felicia Lang, his former colleague. Quite surprising, but this makes sense and is much more believable than him and Pam ending together. He sends a birthday card to Pam, meaning they at least are still in contact. I'm happy they didn't just kill him in some heroic way. Very satisfying end for Mahone.-T-Bag: Robert Knepper was about to become a park ranger before he got the role as T-Bag. He has been amazing. Much like Mahone, T-Bag had a great first half of season as Cole Pfeiffer . He has been OK in the second half but amazing in the finale. It was great to see the creepy, sadistic and evil side of Bagwell again. His conclusion is absolutely perfect. He gets back to Fox River, in his old ways, which brought some ole memories (Nice to see Fox River too). Perfect send off to a great character.-Paul Kellerman. He becomes congressman. How about that lol. Quite underwhelming until Danny Hale's widow returned and spit on his face. Kellerman then sat in his car in reflection, realizing he can't get rid of his past. That was excellent. Another great send off. -Don Self. His ending was quite shocking to me. 4 years later, he ends up just like his wife. Kinda sad but still very ironic.-The General. Poetic justice. He set up Linc for the chair and ends right in that very chair. He was a pity in his last moments.-Sucre/C-Note. Finally happy with their family, nice to see this.-Linc, Michael and Sara. Well this is the "controversial part" for many. Linc is happy, living with Sofia and LJ. The final moments of the series is really moving but imo fitting and with a lot of symbolism. Michael is dead. At the end of the episode; his son, Sara, Sucre, Linc and Mahone visits his grave to pay tribute. Some might say, it's cruel and totally unnecessary but I say that it was fitting. Not that Michael deserves it (far from it) but this really shows him as a tragic character, a hero in way, who sacrificed it all so that his loved ones are happy. And he succeeded in that. I loved those little details they put in here. Like Michael Jr. getting a tattoo or the Origami bird or the quote on the grave; "Be the change you want to see in the world"...something Michael ended up to be in a way. All the people at his grave where together; former junkies, killer and enemy. Everybody changed and were together. More importantly they were all happy. Is it a happy ending?? Well it was sad and tragic but it is a happy ending in many ways. I'm happy they didn't go Hollywood with too much of a soapy ending. The last 10 minutes were brilliant in all aspects. Great directing, great acting, great soundtrack.prefect.These closing moments are where the character ultimately end but still there's 2 extra episodes to be available soon. The events will take place just after the exoneration. So still more PB to come and certainly we'll know more on Mike's death.Hell of a ride really. It has been 4 great seasons. Season 4 is the weakest, still produced some great moments. Season 1 will always be one of the best TV show season I will ever see. The characters are unforgettable. Thank you writers, crew, cast and everybody involved.

No.102 -- The race continues on Prison Break. Now I call it a race because it seems that everyone has to be the first person to accomplish a very risqué task. For instance we have the very obvious five million dollars switching hands every episode or so. Not only is there a pursuit for it but it seems like there is a race to betray anyone helping find the loot. Poor Bellick experienced this tonight as he was conked on the noodle by his former betrayer, Mack.You should have learned bud.Also we have Sucre and his evil cousin Hector in a 'Man in the Iron Mask' situation. With the prize of course being the beautiful Maricruz. Good luck to you both. But the award for most complicated hunt goes to who can kill the always liberated brothers Michael and Lincoln. I'm not sure who to root for between Special Agent Mahone or Special Agent Kellerman. We know it won't be the Dean Cain looking fellow in Lincoln's father's hideout. I feel that Mahone makes for a much more interesting rally against the kin. He in all his evils still manages to pop up in New Mexico and find the happy couple of Michael and Sarah. I must say it was a fierce little skirmish in the warehouse, which brought back memories of a jail-like setting.But no matter what Michael does he still cannot convince Sarah that staying with him is for the better. Or can he? After all she did rethink her departure from his getaway before having the gun pulled on her by Kellerman. If you ask me: Mahone and Kellerman will end up in a battle against themselves. An early prediction by this reviewer would have to have our new friend Mahone come out on top.We'll see what happens. Great show tonight though.Read this review and others at www.mikeontv.com

No.103 -- T Bag is still escaping from the police but his priority now is to find the woman who sent him to prison... And amazingly ( by using some romantic and killing movements) he gets her address. In the other side we have Michael and Lincoln who have finished the last episode pointed by Mahome's gun. Good for them that the police arrives and decide to sent them to Prison. But... they have a long trip back to Fox River and Mahome wants to kill them in the meanwhile with the help of agent Kellerman. During the journey, the car where the soon to be prisoners stops because of a traffic disorder ( Obviously made by Mahome on purpose!), It's their opportunity to escape once more! Michael knows it looks like a trap because everything seems so easy. Anyway, they decide to do it. They start to run and they arrive to a place where Mahome and Kellerman are waiting, ready to shoot them... But when all looks hopeless Kellerman shoots Mahome and invites the prisoners to uncover the President's lies. Because, besides the differences, they all have one thing in common... They know something that President Raynols doesn't want anyone to notice... the TRUTH

No.104 -- "Dr. Sara Tancredi. The only woman I ever loved." Oh come on! Even the least talented screenwriters out there realize that this is much too camp! Michael Scofield's monologue at the beginning, from which this is excerpted, marks as a fairly bad season opener already after 2 minutes. Sadly, nothing gets any better after that. The writers had some grand ideas again (caution: sarcasm), like killing two major roles of season 3 in the first 15 minutes or all convicts somehow escaping Sona because this "high security prison" just burns down. Furthermore, the return of Sara is made very bad, which makes it really difficult for me to like the fact that she's back again. But I'm not done yet: what's up with all the escaped convicts thinking that they can just go around like normal people, while in season 2 they had fake IDs and hiding places and stuff? Of course, each of them gets caught in the first half an hour and of course Michael's highest amount of jail time is 15 years, I'm sure this is a proper amount of time after escaping two penitentiaries and killing someone. I can't exactly say where this episode ends and #2 starts because it's a double episode, but until minute 46, nearly everything that happened was absolutely stupid. This is nothing less than the worst episode of the whole series.

No.105 -- I love this show. This is a very intense show. this show keeps my family and I watching it every week, at the edge of our seats. i think they should somehow convert this into a movie with all the same actors and actresses. this is the best TV show i've seen in a very long time. and Wentworth and Dominic are so attractive - yummy!! I can't wait to watch Monday's show. I hope they get away and are able to prove Lincoln's innocents. I will cry if they don't!! I believe that the Actors and Actress's play every role with everything they have. I also think Miller and Purcell are a great team, they should work together more often.

No.106 -- After the cliffhanger from the previous episode, 'By The Skin And Teeth' - in true Prison Break style, you'd have expected to tune into the latest episode eagerly hoping for a conclusion to the cliffhanger and how Michael and the rest of the escapees will battle on with the plan. That's not what you get with 'Brother's Keeper' - nevertheless, it doesn't disappoint and remains a personal favourite.This episode is set entirely out of context of the rest of the season, it takes place three years before Michael was ever incarcerated in Fox River, with little reference to the prison itself. Amongst those stories of the two brother's been told, we also see what led to the incarceration of Fernando Sucre, Theodore 'T-Bag' Bagwell and Benjamin 'C-Note' Franklin and exactly what they want from the outside after the escape. We also get to see how Dr. Sara Tancredi has a slightly dark past of her own she's kept hidden, as well as a little more of an insight in Captain Bellick's character.From this episode, we get see how Michael came to believe in his brother's innocence and give up everything to devise his brilliant plan to rescue him before execution. Also, watch out for designs for his tattoos and things Michael does that seem to have no apparent relevance in the escape from Fox River - these are foreboding moments for season 2 and shows how his tattoos also hold the key to staying on the outside.Watching the story of the conspiracy unfold, and exactly how The Company and the Secret Service framed Lincoln and pushed for the death penalty is brilliant, and it answers a lot of questions you still may have about it. Danny McCarthy also gets the chance to reprise his role as Secret Service Agent Danny Hale and we see how he and Kellerman have been involved in the thing from the beginning.The episode also includes a brief snippet from America's Most Wanted, which includes a special guest appearance from John Walsh.

No.107 -- I like the 'city is a prison approach' but nothing really memorable happens in this episode. The dialogue that has been written for these characters is so poor, that you don't feel anything when they try to be emotional. This show is spoon feeding the audience the information though forced dialogue, because apparently we can't think and make connections for ourselves. Fortunately, the pacing is fast enough, so you don't dwell on these shortcomings.It's a shame that the prison plot was resolved so quickly because now they rehash the overused conspiracy plot lines which are the far less interesting aspects of the show in my opinion.On a side note: please develop your characters more, Scheuring. Don't use the old familiar ones on the sidelines where don't actual contribute much to the plot and use new faces which you don't give any development (because that screen time is given to the familiar faces; T-Bag, C-Note etc.) If you develop your characters more, than we actually might give a sh*t when someone gets killed of. There all completely forgettable, dull and bland now.But to end on a positive note, the action and pacing keeps me interested and I will tune in next time.

No.108 -- I got used to the numerous inconsistencies and illogical events in this series (the main one being - people getting cured blazingly fast from severe injuries), but this one has gone too far. How did Sara find the brothers' new boat (even before they did)? How did Kim find this new boat? If it took Michal 24 hours to bring the boat to Mahone, how did Link (cuffed to a pipe) go to the toilets? Why have the authorities arrested Michael and sent Sara free if their stories contradicted? If Sucre fell with his face to the ground, why was he found in the next shot lying on his back? Why did the brothers escape from the authorities when all they did was shoot a person who aimed a gun at them? How did Michael manage to open Link's handcuffs with a paper clip in a matter of two seconds? I could go on and on.It seems that in a rush to end the season with everyone in Sona or dead, they let the story slip a bit too much.

No.110 -- It was great but certain plot holes stop being it from More satisfactory .
1.Why Vice President & her agent consider Veronica as Dead when no dead body was found?
2.How veronica & Nick are so less harmed or injured after being so close to door that was Blasted after opening?
3.Why Lincoln did not mention to Pope about the suspicious Visitor who threatened him they difinitely have CCTV footages or Entry Register.
4.The police officer who was investigating murder of Bob got easily fooled by T-BAG as the informant was T-BAGs cell mate plus given the Circumstances and attittude T-Bag should be the first suspicionLittle Character Development:
1.The death of LJ's Mom & stepdad was little underwhelming as we dont get any previous scenes of LJ with his Mom & Step dad about their relationship after the family feud in earlier episodes

No.111 -- ... & because I love PB so much I take in all that season 5 gave me... mainly because I always want Michael to have a happy ending. So much sacrafices for everyone else happiness, he deserves it!But- there was just way too much going on to be jammed into only 9 episodes. It's sad, it should have done better than it was hyped up to be. Again tho- I'm a PB Lover so I couldn't help but love it.Ive watched this season over 5x now... and I still cant wrap my head around why the writers would screw up something so important as his headstone. In season 4 his sickness was revealed to Sara via Linc who mentioned that Michael was turning 31. His original headstone showed his age. I get that the writers wanted to make the new tombstone match our reality timeline but that minor/major mistake just bothers me everytime I do a marathon.& just for an added complaint... in season 4 when Lincoln finds the photo left by mother dearest he tells Mahone that the car is a '78 but Michael was born in '76. However both headstones show Michael born in '74!

No.114 -- As the episode begins, Michael and Lincoln are left chasing Whistler through the streets of Panama. Another solid performance from Chris Vance (Whistler), who only continues to enhance his reputation in a show that could make his career.The tense and dramatic exchange of L.J and Sophia for James is executed superbly through Michael's never-ending genius, but another twist for Sophia sees her go in a different direction than expected.Back in Sona, the inmates are running riot and planning a coup of Luchero. Backed by only T-Bag and a reluctant Bellick, Luchero knows the end is imminent. He believes that his final two compadres are loyal, but of course, as ever, T-Bag has other ideas and wins over the loyalty of the Sona cons. Bellick finally realises that he will be in Sona for the rest of his life and is a broken man.Sucre battles with his conscience and life as he is questioned and threatened with death over the whereabouts of Michael and Lincoln, but he has come too far to sell them out now and resigns himself to a stay inside the walls of Sona, the new Sona, T-Bag's Sona.With Sophia and Lincoln now seemingly on the path to getting together, and L.J finally safe, Michael discovers new information about Whistler and believes this will lead him to the woman who killed Sarah.Whistler, Grechen and Mahone are now a team, ready to face the unanswered questions, but with a vengeful Scofield on their tail.Now the Writers Strike is resolved, let us wait patiently and with much excitement for what I can only assume will be Season 4 of prison break, as opposed to episode 14 of season 3.

No.115 -- Michael in his new cell in the corner observes the snipers accuracy using a rat. The newcomer in Sona Andrew Tyge is robbed by Sammy; Bellick tries to approach to him. Michael asks for new pictures of Sara and LJ to Lincoln, and schedules the break-out at 3 PM. Then he exposes his plan to Whistler, and they observe the towers seeking a breach. They decide to invite Mahone to help them. Sucre using the identity of Jorge Rivera is forced by a stranger to smuggle a package into Sona and promises US$ 5,000.00 to him. Lincoln and Sofia are intercepted by the police in a side road while seeking a getaway route and Lincoln uses a plan-B, buying some supplies and driving to Solana Beach. Lechero's hooker tells that Augusto is not paying for her services. She steals some money and T-Bag tells Lechero that he gave the amount to her. Michael prepares a device to interfere in the television signal; however, the guard sees his binoculars and believes it is a gun. The patrol breaks in Sona, and Whistler assumes the blame telling that he was watching birds and shows the bird guide to the commander. Andrew recognizes Whistler as McFadden, who was in Nice in 1997 with an ambassador.In this episode, the story is stalled, and the greatest question is who James Whistler or McFadden is. The new inmate performed by Dominic Keating from "Enterprise" is also intriguing. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Interferência" ("Interference")

Terrible. 24 reboot was bad but this one takes the cake. Wooden expressions, no emotion as if actors are being forced to earn their paychecks and on top of it an absurd plot with more holes that possible.

No.118 -- Michael and his team use the printed pictures of Michael footage with the cell to identify the first card holder, Lisa Tabak, the wife of the Turkish's consul in LA. They discover that she is about to leave Los Angeles, but first she will attend an LAPD Benefit Convention called "Eagles and Angels". Agent Self tells Sara that Bruce Bennett was found dead in his apartment, and the disturbed and upset Sara feels guilty for his death. Michael and Lincoln sees T-Bag, but the criminal hides the Birds Guide and they have to leave him when the security guard of a building sees the brothers pressing the well dressed scumbag. Self calls Jasper, but Wyatt arrives first and the agent finds him dead in his apartment. Michael, Lincoln and Sucre break in a police warehouse; they steal badges and uniforms and go to the convention. While Sara is in a bar near to drink booze, the alcoholic client Shepard pickpockets Bruce Bennett's card from her purse. Michael, Lincoln and Mahone go to the event, but Lincoln is recognized by one Company's bodyguard; however, Bellick stabs the agent and saves Lincoln, who thanks him. While Gretchen is tortured by Wyatt, he receives a call telling that Bruce Bennett's credit card was used in a bar; later he follows Sara. In New York City, Shan Xing confesses that he does not have the Scylla card and is stabbed. T-Bag is welcomed in Gate and sent to a corner office as requested. Mahone asks Roland to hack the FBI files and check the profile of the professional killer that murdered his son.In this good episode, Michael and his crew succeed in copying the second Scylla card in a dangerous assignment in the middle of half LAPD force. Bruce and Jasper are gone, but Mahone is chasing Wyatt and Gretchen is still alive. The most intriguing part is the clever and cynical T-Bag inside Gate pretending to be the salesman Cole Pfeiffer (with double-f). The disturbance of Sara and her reckless attitude going to the bar will certainly have a price to the group. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available

Mondays really suck because its the beginning of the week and everyone knows how that feels, but knowing that this show is on kinda makes the first day of the week bearable. every show ends in a way that makes you can't wait till next week although i hate the long wait the show is definitely worth it.

No.120 -- General Krantz tells Lincoln that the price of Michael's surgery is the safe return of Scylla. Lincoln tortures T-Bag to find the location where Self and Gretchen will deal with the buyer; after losing two teeth, T-Bag tells that the meeting will be in Arlington Pier at 3:00 PM. Lincoln and Sucre head to the place, but Rita calls Gretchen and tells that the Company abducted T-Bag. When they arrive, Self and Gretchen have already gone. Sara stays with Michael and she does not recognize the equipment and the procedure in the surgery room, but the doctor informs that it is a state-of-art technique. In a blink of eyes, Michael meets Charles in Fox River, and he asks for his forgiveness. Charles advises that things are not like they seem to be, and Michael tries to find the true meaning of his words and the word Bargain on the wall. Meanwhile Mahone asks to go to the bathroom and the reluctant Wheeler finally stops the car. Mahone steals a pipe and jumps from Wheeler's car after shattering the window. He is chased by Agent Lang and Wheeler, and Lang covers his escape in the end. The Company tracks Gretchen's call in her cellular, but when Lincoln and Sucre arrive, the buyer escapes with Scylla and they capture Self and Gretchen. Michael deciphers that Scylla is not a black book with the past of The Company, but a secret of power and The Company is actually protecting the future. Lincoln discovers that his mother also worked for The Company and splits with Michael in the name of the "family business"."Prison Break" is literally going under in this Season. The shows are no longer engaging like they were in the past, and the plot has no where to go and not everything is like it seems anymore. The possibility of Lincoln working with Gretchen, Self and T-Bag is too much for me. My deception with this Fourth Season is increasing after each episode, and I hope the author Paul Scheuring does give the same fate of "Lost" to this series.

No.121 -- Lincoln tells Michael that they have four more days to rescue Whistler, but Michael is upset with his brother that used him. Gretchen has a meeting with General and they decide to use power to release Whistler in an operation called "Bang and Burn"; later she asks Whistler to kill Michael. In Sona, the guards reinforce the bars in the windows, and Michael tells Lechero that this way it will be difficult to break-out. Sammy requests more men to Lechero to keep Sona under control. Sofia receives a call from Whistler's mysterious landlord telling that he has some "insurance papers" from her boyfriend; however, the Company intercepts the conversation. When Sofia receives the documents, she finds a passport of Whistler in the name of Gary Miller. But Gretchen arrives and takes the documents. Mahone tells Agent Lang how he killed Shales and then he addicted in pills, and asks her to get some drugs for him otherwise he will not be able to speak in the hearing. T-Bag gives a message from Lechero with the blueprint of his cell with a hidden door and an access code. Whistler is ready to stab Michael when Lechero arrives and he hides the knife. Michael asks McGrady to request his father to call Lincoln and tell him: "-Don't come home for dinner." Mahone fails in the hearing and is sent back to Sona. Lincoln, Sucre and Sofia are attacked by the Company's agents and the brothers realize that something is happening, i.e., the Company does not need them anymore. When the "Bang and Burn" Operation begins, Michael catches Whistler and Gretchen fails in her intent. The command of Sona captures Michael for the attempt of breaking-out."Bang and Bum" is one of the best shows of the Third Season. Now the story is moving on, with many twists and new situations. Who is Whistler is probably the greatest question in this moment. The fate of LJ is also very doomed after the failure of the operation leaded by Gretchen. Mahone back to Sona is great since this killer deserves his destiny. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Tentativa de Fuga" ("Attempt of Breakin-out")

Meanwhile, the FBI Agernt Alexander Mahone is assigned to track the fugitives, and he investigates the last steps of Michael before going to Fox River, trying to think like him and understand his tattoos. The heartbroken Sara survives to the OD in the hospital and awakes from the coma. Later she finds an origami in her purse with a ciphered message of Michael. Veronica discovers that she is locked in the armored mansion with Terrence and there is no way out. She decides to call the police and while talking to Lincoln, armed men from the Company arrive and kill her. T-Bag brings his severed hand to a veterinary clinic and forces the veterinary surgeon to implant it without anesthesia.In this first episode of the Second Season, the smart FBI Agent Alexander Mahone is introduced and shows that he is a very clever man. However, Veronica is gone and I regret it since the sweet character performed by Robin Tunney was one of my favorites. The number of casualties due to the attempt to save Lincoln is impressive: his ex-wife, her husband, the bishop, Leticia, Veronica, her fiancé, her doorman, Nick, Danny plus the tragedies in Michael, Sara and LJ's lives.

The show came to a logical conclusion, but then there are these two retro episodes. Hey! Lets go to a women's prison and do a break-out there! Yawn.

But coming to think of the way the ending was done it was not quite satisfactory. It was very much obvious that Scylla was never going to be in the hands of evil and Michael and CO would do their best to ensure that but that happened too soon... I mean the way each episode leading up to the end was made, i can only say it's rushed and as we all know if it is rushed it's not going to be good. But that's the great thing about this series that even a rushed thing was made to look good but not great... anyway all in all a wonderful experience... All the actors were living their characters and it was such an excellent performance from the protagonist "Wentworth Miller" as Michael Scofield... Please someone clarify why he had to be killed...

No.125 -- Prison Break continues to impress me with its originality, suspense, and generally smart plots. It's not getting old in season two, and it's just as good as season one, if not better. This isn't true of a lot of shows of this nature, such as Lost, but Prison Break is different. This episode especially had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I just sat there stunned when it ended. The number of plot twists in this episode far exceeded any other episode to this point, and it was incredibly well done.I don't know how they do it, but I'm glad they do! Watching this episode, you worry that Kellerman will kill them all, then you cheer when you realize who he's really going after, then you change your mind again when you realize the brothers need the president alive. Meanwhile, we get more of the brotherly love that got Scofield in this situation to begin with and a measure of uncertainty in the Scofield/Sara and Lincoln/LJ relationships. Even T-Bag and C-Note are making sacrifices for their loved ones. The emotions are running high in this must-see episode!

I felt sorry for the fate of DB Cooper and Nick, but the condition of Sara is heartbreaking. The betrayal of Michel to Warden Pope is also a sad moment of the show. I foresee that the despicable Vice-President will be eliminated sooner. I am curious with the fate of the scum John Abruzzi, but the revelation of DB will certainly arise the greed of the runaways.

No.128 -- So again here, they do the dumbest thing possible. If it weren't fiction I would seriously doubt Michael's intentions to save himself and his brother thanks to the stupid things he does. So The brothers have the best thing they could hope for - Terence Stead man, alive and kicking, passport to their innocence, freedom everything and a Secret Service Agent now turned against the President helping them. It's like God's blessing them with everything they could ask for, but no, they have to do something stupid. So Michael here is not able to bear that he is not the in charge. And despite Keller man explained to to him how important is Steadman alive for them, how he has the answers to all of Caroline's secrets that eventually will set them free, how Steadman is useless otherwise and how Michael and Lincoln are totally screwed without his help, Michael good s on to act all macho, As if he is suffering from some disorder where he has to prove he is the leader. He goes ahead and calls a media house telling them his address and hoping to turn himself in. Surprisingly they are not prepared for Steadman trying to escape after this call. The old man manages to snatch the gun from Lincoln, the guy who's supposed to be so tough. Michael emotionally blackmails him about how so many ppl are dead because of him and asks him to turn himself in. Like such moral lectures work in the real world. Once satisfied , they don't bother to even try to get the gun from him. And tortured by Michael' s blackmailing Steadman kills himself. Height of nonsense. You would ruin something so perfect that was given to you only if you purposely wanted to screw everything. So much for male machoism and men trying to take all decisions.

No.129 -- Michael's death made me feel emotional. I wasn't expecting this would happening at the end but when I just saw that grave, I was totally amazed with the invisible tears and keep watching that scene again and again.

No.130 -- The original 4-series was an astounding achievement! But this season 5 is so much worst. The directing & camera angle is more intense but the storyline is just plain stupid and not worthy to be a successor. It's only 10 episodes. The ultimate goal of the entire season is not intriguing, the antagonist has bad acting, and does not involve a grand scale conspiracy like the original 4 seasons.If you want to proceed to Season 6, make sure the story writer create a spectacular grand conspiracy involving nation leaders around the globe. Otherwise, say GOODBYE to Prison Break series.

No.131 -- Well from the very first episode you would start wondering how these guys gonna escape eventually.With slew of twists,It becomes unpredictable.And when you watch this episode "Tonight" ,It leaves you spellbind. D-cooper kills anxiety by hitting Bellick very hard. and soon their plans reduces to tonight from 3 Days. It becomes more gripping. Even though you aren't fond of chemistry or romance between, MiSa (Michale & Sara) does splendid job to make you love their every presence together.The conversation between Sarah & Scofield will melt your heart. You would ask yourself if this is their last scenes together??You cannot simply miss this.Who would have imagined how Scofield would get his brother to infirmary.Superb twist with feeling sorry about Pope.And the outstanding background scores when each of the escapee shown recalling their dream moments which is gonna be true soon. Best of the this episode. You gotta believe me . Disclaimer: "Its killing me to know you aren't gonna believe" "Was It all an act" There could be better TV series but have not found any as addictive as Prison Break.

No.132 -- Hello, I am Lincoln Burrows and I am the most wanted man on earth. Oh look, someone just saw me and went to tell that to the police officer next to him. Well, it is probably nothing to worry about. *45 seconds later" Oh, f#ck the police caught me. How unfortunate. Prison Break is full of some of the most sh!t writing I have ever seen in my life, and I have seen and read more than 99% of the most hardcore fans of any entertainment medium. The writer is surely a troll who hates on his own series. I curse his ass.

No.133 -- Directed by highly successful Hollywood producer and director, Brett Ratner, known for 'Rush Hour' and 'Red Dragon',this pilot episode entices from the outset. In the first three minutes alone, the unnamed protagonist has a full-body tattoo completed, before removing all evidence from his apartment, from the newspaper clippings stuck to the windows, to disposing his hard-disc drive from his balcony into the waters below, and then, intentionally allowing himself to be detained whilst committing armed robbery. Moreover, despite the seriousness of his situation, our protagonist ignores his attorney's advice, and leaves the charges uncontested.The twists keep coming as after being incarcerated, his interest in the high profile death row inmate, Lincoln Burrows, convicted for the murder of the Vice-President's brother, is revealed as being down to the fact that he is the condemned man's younger sibling. Furthermore, the audience soon learns he is there to engineer his brother's escape.With such an enthralling premise, one hopes that the success the writer, Paul Scheuring, has enjoyed since this pilot was aired, has been shared to some extent with a former female colleague who suggested the basic plot to him. Given the fact that aside from the screenplay for the Vin Diesel vehicle, 'A Man Apart' Scheuring was an unknown quantity, and given the complexity of the premise, Fox were initially reluctant to produce the show. However, the success of 'Lost' persuaded them to back the project, and they were further emboldened by Ratner's attachment to the project as executive producer. The latter had become attracted first and foremost by the originality of the script.With him Ratner brought twice Oscar-nominated cinematographer, Dante Spinotti, impressing the Academy Awards for his work on 'LA Confidential' and 'The Insider'. The opening episode of this new project was thereby provided with such a slick and stylish gloss. In terms of the casting process, the writer has revealed the difficulty he and Ratner had in casting the male lead. In fact, the show was just one week from production when Wentworth Miller auditioned.Miller's previous career breakthrough performance had been as the young Anthony Hopkins in 'A Human Stain'. Here he is thoroughly convincing as the self-assured and highly intelligent structural engineer, Michael Scofield. The menacing atmosphere of Scofield's new home at Fox River State Penitentiary is neatly summed up by his cell-mate when, after witnessing the latent violence of his new surroundings, the latter welcomes him to 'Prisneyland'.As characters emerge, the viewer at times feels the impulse for a necessary rewind to the clippings seen earlier on Scofield's apartment window. Each character is revealed as having great relevance for Scofield, without us, the audience, having their precise significance for Scofield's plans amateurishly 'telegraphed'. This is no more the case than with the mobster, John Abruzzi, unofficially in charge of the distribution of prison jobs.Needing a means to get access to his brother, Scofield proceeds to riskily entice Abruzzo with discovering the whereabouts of the squealer whose testimony had him convicted of a double murder. Having borne the brunt of a physical beating, Scofield is rewarded with a work detail alongside his brother, Burrows.Then there is the prison doctor, and daughter of the local governor, Sara Tancredi, who Scofield shamelessly flaunts with, while feigning diabetes, to access the medical facility for an as-yet unknown motive. The extent of our protagonist's assuredness is also highlighed by his tactful handling of Stacy Keach's prison warden to avoid being placed in solitary confinement in return for his assistance in answering the structural issues within the warden's anniversary gift of the model of the Taj Mahal.The enticing mystery is not confined to the characters alone. Within the quick-fire opening sequence within Scofield's apartment, the brief shot of an origami swan so obviously implies that this seemingly immaterial object will take on much greater significance in the development of the plot across subsequent episodes.The episode does have its flaws - principally the lame treatment given to the strand of the story concerning Burrows' son. Having witnessed the incarceration of both his father and uncle, the latter falls off the rails and is arrested for attempting to sell illegal substances. What should come across as an empathetic understanding of the damaging effect of this loss of parental guidance on Burrow's son, instead, feels much more like a convenient and mechanistic sub-plot. Yet, although there is an unbelievable leniency in terms of custodial sentencing, this sub-plot does provide the writer and the director an opportunity to show the murderer on death row in a familial light - his advice to his son carrying some weight: 'I don't want you to love me...I want you to love yourself.'Aside from these minor distractions, the intricate plot keeps the pace brisk, with it becoming gradually evident to the audience that Lincoln's claims of being framed may be true. The slaying of the bishop, played by Chelcie Ross, poised to offer Burrows reprieve from the chair, so soon after being threatened by the secret services is strongly suggestive that there are powerful interests wishing the truth to be buried with the man Scofield has come to rescue.The episode, having started with the low buzz of the tattoo artist's needle, brilliantly ends with one of the best 'reveals' within recent TV history. This concerns the revelation that the engineering works conducted at Fox Rover had been contracted out under the table to Scofield's company, and he has not simply committed these to memory, but has a permanent record of them by means of disguising them within the tattoos on his body.

No.134 -- Man, this is not a good episode. It seemed like everyone is tired, Dominic Purcell is phoning it in here pretty bad. It has no life at all this episode, and really slowed the season down so far. Episode 4 was great, but last two are similar episode 3, which was bad as well. This show is very inconsistent at the moment. The characters this episode were stupid, dumb and nothing like themselves, all seem tired. The new Company type agents were over exposed here, were very disappointing and are downright comical. Cyclops was a joke as well throughout, comical again. I'm not sure why no T-bag or Sarah here, they were desperately needed. Whip is the all star of the show, he is the only one trying at the moment. Can't wait till season is over, let it rest.

No.135 -- Vincent Sandinsky denies any relationship with Christina to Lincoln and his team, but Michael calls his brother and informs that the scientist had many phone and e-mails with their mother. However, General Krantz and his men unexpectedly arrive and assume the interrogatory of Vincent. Michael and Sara kidnap Christina, but the evil woman manipulates them, disturbing Michael with the information that Lincoln was adopted and Sara with her pregnancy; she reverts the situation and escapes. Lincoln and his team and Michael head to a congress of global energy technology in a hotel in Miami. When Mahone and Self see a silver van parked outside the hotel, he suspects that they have been framed. T-Bag is ordered to execute Vincent to be part of his Company's team."S.O.B" is another episode with many twists and the most important is the information that Lincoln was an orphan adopted by Michael's father. Christina and T-Bag show their cold blood their own way. The impulsive Lincoln will get into trouble again. It is amazing how a man carrying a wallet manages to escape running from Lincoln, Self and Mahone. Fortunately this series is coming to an endMy vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available

No.136 -- Bad cgi.
Low budget.
Poor sets.
No character development.
Cnotes character bears no resemblence to his former self.
Same old white villains with blonde hair or old white men.
Fight scenes poor.
Packed full of liberal propaganda trying to promote Islam and interacial religions/relationships.
Full of plot holes after they broke Sarah out in that 90 minute special.
Same conspiracy plot which starts to get a bit repetitive
It's just an all over dissapointment.

No.138 -- This episode continued the great start that this show got off to last week. While I'm sure it dropped in viewership, it doesn't change the fact that this episode might have been better put together than the premiere. Michaels motives still remain quite a mystery, and his involvement with isis is very intriguing. We get some cool action scenes with Lincoln and C- note, but T-bags and Sucres absences bring the episode down a little. However, the return of fan favorite Paul Kellerman easily makes up for it. I am interested to see how the final 7 episodes play out considering that every other season had at least 13 episodes to tell its story. This episode won't get anyone else hooked on the show, but it certainly won't drive viewers away either.

No.139 -- Well, I am shocked. What an anti-climax.I have never seen such forced writing, action or plot elements to end a story than in this debacle of an ending.For a show that in the first season had you seriously concerned and tense for the characters and their predicament, it never seemed likely the bad guys would win. Some old characters would resurface from nowhere like a deus ex machina to save the day. Lincoln survives for god knows how long after being shot.Sarah, who moans about Michael pointing guns at people ends up shooting someone.Schofield and Sarahs relationship is so sterile i doubt they could ever of had sex - I have never even seen them kiss. They just hug and look worried on each others shoulders. Ridiculous.I personally started disliking prison break after series 2 - season four has been a complete waste of time. If they were going to do it, they should of done it correctly. Its bad storytelling, bad writing, bad acting, the reduction of good characters to ones that haven't developed at all from the second series.Poor. So so poor. Its a shame. Move on to The Wire people, much more of a complete show.

No.140 -- So, the second episode in the season of stupidities. First stupidity when Veronica walks inside Terence Stead man's house saying hello to him, without any weapon, without any protection, thinking she will be allowed to stroll in there and call the cops after a cozy chat and thus gets herself killed. Episode 1. In episode 2, Lincoln and Michael decide to rescue LJ from the courthouse, except just near the courthouse Lincoln decides to stand openly on the streets outside a shop from which Mike is buying supplies, without a hat, without his goggles, without any kind of disguise and wink and nod at passing ladies. I mean, seriously? Is that what two guys, whose photos have been plastered all over newspapers and walls and one of whom is on death row for murdering the President's brother for God's sake, about to run off with a lad from the courthouse do? Which world of stupidity do they come from? Which person about to break into a courthouse and steal a criminal nods and smiles at passersby, especially when he himself is on the most wanted list? Height of nonsense.

No.143 -- I am a huge fan of "Prison Break" but this episode(2x12) was a little strange. First of all i have to say that Sara spent a lot of time under the water...and she had her mouth opened...and after she escape how does she manage to do those injuries by falling on that car... anything else...i am starting to hate that FBI agent Mahone...and i really wanna know how they will escape now(the brothers). One of the best thing that happens in this episode is that t-bag is beginning to be very smart :D ....And please don't kill Sucre in episode 2x13. And i have some question.... 1.Is the cop going to be sent at Fox River? 2.Will Mahone turn into a good person? 3.Will the secret agent Kellerman die? And one other thing please kill that Chinese or Japanese guy

No.144 -- Lazily plotted and corny ham-fisted set-up episode which, despite these aspects still leaves you wanting to watch the rest of the series. As a former Prison Break watcher, who loved the first season, liked the second season, enjoyed the third season and hated most of the fourth season, I went in expecting lazily plotted overused story lines and poorly written on the nose expositionary dialogue. It was exactly what I got. ISIL??... Really?I had a hard time getting through the predictable first 30 minutes which establishes that Sarah Wayne Callies is just as annoying and boring as she has always been as Sarah Tancredi (except maybe in the first season). These first 30 minutes also make you remember how bad the fourth season was, because they pull the same conspiracy bullsh*t here. The last five minutes gave me hope that they will give more of the vibes from the first season and (poor but still enjoyable) third season.When you go into this revival series not giving a damn, you will actually like more than you'd expected in the first place. Let's see where this goes.
